Among all the platforms where I played during this last two months, one was clearly predominant – the good old Game Boy. Hyped up by the release of [Alentejo: Tinto's Law](https://joaomarques.website/abxy/alentejo-tintos-law), I decided to build my own custom Game Boy out of a broken one, in its _Pocket_ variant. The result was a system with a translucid red shell, a backlit IPS screen and a terrible battery life because of it. However, it isn't that big of an issue considering most of its games are quite short in lenght — a key factor for why you'll see so many of the listed bellow.

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</h3>
RPG / Xbox Series X
<br><br>

I feel I'm doing a misservice to this game by not dedicating my playing time entirely to it, as two months have passed and I'm still far from finishing it. In classic JRPG fashion, its beggining is painfully slow, but its finally reaching the tipping point where all the build up and exposition is finnaly paying off.

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Super Mario Land</h3>
Platformer / Game Boy
<br><br>

This was the first game I played in my "brand-new" Game Boy. It was quite fitting, considering it was one of the launch games of the system back in 1989, and it shows. _Super Mario Land_ isn't a bad game by any means, but it was largely outclassed by its successor in every aspect.

Platformer / Game Boy
<br><br>

It's difficult to think of any other sequel that improved so much within the same technical constrains as its predecessor. _Super Mario Land 2_ looks and plays like a game from an entirely different system. The sheer variety of locations to explore is impressive. From a garden, an ocean, a gigantic _mecha-Mario_, even the moon, there is a lot to choose from! As if it wasn't enough, this game had the honor of introducing Wario, as the main villain.

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Earthbound</h3>
RPG / SNES
<br><br>

_EarthBound_, also known as _Mother 2_ in Japan, is the game that preceded [_Mother 3_](https://joaomarques.website/abxy/mother-3) (shocking, right?), my favourite game from all the ones I played last year. It was no surprise that I really wanted to play this game as well, specially because many fans consider it the best of the series. After playing and finishing it, I don't think it's superior to _Mother 3_, but it's quite special nonetheless. There isn't really anything like Shigesato Itoi's games. It's a damned shame he only made three.
