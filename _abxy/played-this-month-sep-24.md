[Ooo wee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-_crlOw0HA), September, am I right? During this month I was able to finish the games I was playing last month and also to have a glimpse into October and the new games that come with it. September 2024 was also the month where I finally jumped into the next generation of consoles, or is it _current_ generation, since it's already almost four years old? Anyway, I got an Xbox Series X, which also had some impact on the games I played.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</h3>
Action-adventure / PS3
<br><br>

What a game! It's all I have to say now that I finished it. Expect a full review of it soon. I still have no idea of what I want to say about it, but I'll get there eventually.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Persona</h3>
RPG / PSP
<br><br>

Speaking of reviews, I'm also done with Persona, however my opinion about this one isn't as positive. You can already read my review [here](https://joaomarques.website/abxy/persona)!
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Lego City Undercover</h3>
Action-adventure / Nintendo Switch
<br><br>

This was something that I had for many years in my purgatory of unfinished games. I don't even know why I abandoned it in the first place, as it isn't a very long game to begin with, except if you decide to collect everything. Since I have better ways to waste my time, I decided to focus mostly on the main story. Overall it was a fun game, but nothing to write home about.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Grand Theft Auto: Stories from Liberty City</h3>
Action-adventure / Xbox 360
<br><br>

As I stated in the intro paragraph, I just got an Xbox Series X. But as typical of this generation, I got the system but no games for it. However, this was nothing but a big brain plan from my side to test the backwards compatibility with Xbox 360 games, starting with GTA Stories from Liberty City, which is a standalone compilation of the two GTA IV expansions. I already finished the first one, The Lost and the Damned, but I still have the second one to play. In terms of gameplay, well, it's more GTA, but with different protagonists. The true highlight here is the 60fps boost from playing it on the Series X. _Chef's kiss._
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Metaphor: ReFantazio (Prologue Demo)</h3>
RPG / Xbox Series X
<br><br>

It was great to have a glimpse of what will become of my gaming life until the end of this year, at least, by starting my journey in the highly anticipated Metaphor: ReFantazio. This is one of those demos that let you carry the save data to the full game, once it's out by October 11th. So, if you are into RPGs and have a PC, PS4, PS5 or Xbox Series, please try this. It's all I ask. It costs you nothing, except time. 
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</h3>
Action-adventure / Nintendo Switch
<br><br>

Right at the tail end of the month, a wild new Zelda game appears! This time around we actually play as Zelda, who can replicate an innumerable amount of objects and enemies with her magic rod. This concept sounds a bit silly, but as soon as I started to play the game, it became second nature.
<br><br><br>

<br>
That's all for September! For next month I'll be deep into Zelda and Metaphor for sure. Oh, and there'll be also the new Shadow the Hedgehog game. Well, another busy month ahead. See you next time!
