Welcome to the first "Played this month". This will be, as the name suggests, a series where I give some brief personal opinion about the games I played during the month that just ended. In January I tried a few new games (new at least for me), but only two of them really got my full attention and dedication. Here's what I played:
<br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Final Fantasy VII Remake</h3>
Action RPG / PS4
<br><br>

The first part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy was the first game I finished this year. It's focused in Midgar, where the original game starts, giving to the city a gigantic facelift with detailed graphics, for the most part, and spectacular cutscenes, in classic Square Enix fashion, and introducing a new action focused combat system. Overall it was a great experience, but not without a few flaws, like some lackluster side quests, to give an example.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Pikmin 4</h3>
Real-time strategy / Nintendo Switch
<br><br>

As a Pikmin fan, this was a game I knew I would have a great time with, even before starting to play it. After almost 40 hours of gameplay and 100% completion, it managed to not only match my high expectations but even surpass them. I will keep it short for now, as I will do a full review of Pikmin 4 soon.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia</h3>
Tactical RPG / Nintendo 3DS
<br><br>

My quest to find a Fire Emblem game that I like more than [Three Houses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkux5h0PeXo) is yet prove to be fruitless. Echoes: Shadows of Valentia was the closest I got from that, but even so, I didn't have the drive to keep playing it until the end. My save file was abandoned for almost an year, much like my Nintendo 3DS. I decided to do a quick battle, just to try to get back in the game, but I forgot completely the story so far and many of the characters. I may need to watch a recap before playing more.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Very Very Valet</h3>
Casual / Nintendo Switch
<br><br>

A few weeks ago in a company retreat I had, I tried a few casual multiplayer games whose names I can't even remember, but one of them stood from the crowd to me. [Very Very Valet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feyHL0GfcIo) combined the Overcooked-like co-op strategy with some crazy driving mechanics, in the same style as [Micro Machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5x547gzU_g) or [R.C. Pro-Am](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA-430ZNqZg), to deliver an hilariously chaotic experience.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Shin Megami Tensei V</h3>
RPG / Nintendo Switch
<br><br>

After enjoying [Persona 4](https://joaomarques.website/abxy/abxy/persona-4-golden) and [5](https://joaomarques.website/abxy/abxy/persona-5-royal) so much, I decided to try the series that started it all, just to realize how brutally difficult it is, to the point that on my third regular battle, I was presented with the Game Over screen. SMT V is what can be described as a true "hardcore" experience. It didn't convinced me in the same way as its more successful spinoff, as so, I will put this game on hold for now. The only thing I truly enjoyed during my brief time with it, was its soundtrack. Seriously, it seems like Atlus simply can't make games without some [bangers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohi99qWYngc).

And that's all for January. For next month, one thing I know for sure, it will be all about the new Persona 3 Reload. See you next time!
