What a month, people, what a month! October was monumental in terms of new releases. We had a new Zelda (technically it came at the tail end of September, but I ended up playing it mostly in October), we had Metaphor: ReFantazio, we even had an exceptional Sonic game (or should we say Shadow game?)! And I'm only mentioning the ones that resonate with me, there were even more great games coming out. Anyway, here's what I've been playing:
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</h3>
Action-adventure / Nintendo Switch
<br><br>

This was one of those games that I played non-stop until the end, without getting tired of it for a bit. That by itself is a great demonstration of its quality. I had my issues with it though, but for that, read the full review of the game [here](https://joaomarques.website/abxy/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom).
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Metaphor: ReFantazio</h3>
RPG / Xbox Series X
<br><br>

Metaphor is finally out! In true Atlus fashion, this looks like a game to last many dozens of hours, so expect me to talk about it for even longer than I already am. For now, with 18 hours clocked in, I can only say that I'm loving it.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Need for Speed Unbound</h3>
Racing / Xbox Series X
<br><br>

As a long-time NFS fan, I was interested in Unbound since I saw it for the first time. Unfortunately it didn't come out for last-gen consoles, so now that I have Xbox Series X I decided to finally try it out. So far, my experience is being mostly positive, but I have a couple of complaints about the progression and AI behavior during the races. But I'll save them for a full review.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Die Hard Trilogy</h3>
Light-gun shooter / PS1
<br><br>

I've been in Madrid this last month and I took the opportunity to do a tour through the city's amazing retro gaming stores. One of my acquisitions was a light-gun for the PS1. My hope was to play [Time Crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZsUNE9I9Mc), but I soon realized my gun wasn't compatible with it. Luckily there was another game in my collection that was, being it precisely this Die Hard Trilogy. Actually the shooting section is only one of the three different gameplay styles it has to offer, each one themed after a different movie, thence the "Trilogy" in the title. While still inferior to Time Crisis, I had a good time with it.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Sonic x Shadow Generations</h3>
Action-adventure / Xbox Series X
<br><br>

Sonic fans, we're feasting! As someone who played and liked very much Sonic Generations back in the day, I had reasonable expectations for this re-release as _Sonic x Shadow Generations_. What I wasn't expecting was for the brand-new Shadow Generations game to be my favourite part of the compilation, by far! I want to write a review for it soon, but I'm still pondering if it deserves the "Masterpiece" rating or not. Either way, it's the closest thing to a perfect 3D Sonic game we ever had, in my opinion.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Grand Theft Auto: Stories from Liberty City</h3>
Action-adventure / Xbox 360
<br><br>

I've finished the second and last expansion included in this compilation - The Ballad of Gay Tony - where we play as the right-hand/bodyguard of the nightclub entrepreneur Tony Prince, who is, of course, also involved in many illegal activities. One of those is the selling of some stolen diamonds that goes horribly wrong and escalates to epic proportions. In terms of gameplay, this expansion has much more variety than anything else in the GTA IV universe, with a big focus on skydiving, helicopters and boats. Storywise, I feel like this expansion had potential to be a full game, as some particular points were a bit rushed because of the smaller number of missions, in comparison with GTA IV's main story.

That's all for October! For next month, well, probably even more Metaphor: ReFantazio. I'll tell you then.
