For the first time since January, I was able to publish at least two game reviews here at ABXY! To the ones who've read them, thank you. I hope you like the stuff I wrote, even if sometimes it's nonsense gibberish. By the way, feel free to give feedback if you have any (I believe I have my X profile on the footer)! Anyway, this month was also prolific in terms of games finished, which means more reviews to write. It's a never ending circle, what have I done...
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Mother 3</h3>
RPG / GBA
<br><br>

The first game I finished this month. This is one I'll never forget, for how funny and emotional it was. I'll save the details for a full review, but you can count on a "Masterpiece" evaluation.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Sonic Adventure</h3>
Action-adventure / Sega Dreamcast
<br><br>

On the very same day, I also finished Sonic Adventure. You can already read [my review](https://joaomarques.website/abxy/sonic-adventure) of it!
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</h3>
RPG / Nintendo Switch
<br><br>

This was a game that I intended to play on its original GameCube version, but then I found the recently released Switch remaster at a good price and decided to go for it. I only played for a couple of hours, but it was enough to defeat the first boss. I will keep this one on hold until I finish the other games I have in progress.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope</h3>
Turn-based strategy / Nintendo Switch
<br><br>

I got this game last year as a birthday gift for myself, but it didn't click for me as its predecessor (Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle) even after playing until almost half of its campaign. In an effort to finish games I had in progress, I decided to give it a second chance. I'm glad I did it, as I was able to ignore the things I didn't like before and focus on the good ones, in particular the unique combat system that blends turn-based with real-time strategy.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">EA FC 24</h3>
Football simulation / Nintendo Switch
<br><br>

It's Euro time! Or it was, until Portugal and every underdog I was rooting for were eliminated. But before that, I was able to do a run with Ronaldo and company in EA FC 24 and lift the trophy. Case to say that in my simulation the captain was the best scorer of the tournament, which unfortunately proved to be a shocking departure from reality.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</h3>
Action-adventure / PS3
<br><br>

I'm back to the biggest Kojima's fever dream! I needed some time away from the Metal Gear Solid series to properly assimilate the first game, but now I'm ready to embrace its sequel.
<br><br><br>

And that's all for June. During July I'll probably be fully invested in Metal Gear and all its craziness. I'll tell you how it went next month.
