Hi there, long time no see! How were your first two months of 2025? Mine were absolutely chaotic for the most part, hence the long hiatus on this blog. During that time however, gaming didn't stop. Gaming never stops. This sounded a bit cringe, because it was, but if you are here you probably already reached the conclusion that playing videogames is a bit more than just a hobby for me. It's still fundamentally a hobby however, and it helped me get through these difficult months on a personal level.
<br><br>
Without further ado, here's what I played during January and February.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</h3>
Action-adventure / Nintendo Switch
<br><br>

This was a game that I wanted to play since it was announced, as I mentioned in the last [Played This Month](https://joaomarques.website/abxy/played-this-month-nov-24). By being bluntly inspired by Sega's classic _Jet Set Radio_, _Bomb Rush_ is without surprise all about rollerblades (plus bikes and skates), graffiti and style. However, I was expecting a bit more from it, I must confess. The gameplay is superb, but the story and progression are a bit confusing for the most part. The strongest aspect of Bomb Rush, in my opinion, is its soundtrack.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</h3>
Action-adventure / PSP, PS3
<br><br>

Yes, another Metal Gear game. This time around, it's one that sounds like a spin-off, but it isn't! Since it was originally made for the PSP, it has a different structure from its predecessors, being divided into smaller mission chapters and with a lot (and I mean a LOT) of optional activities. The worst part of it was actually playing it on a PSP, since it desperately needed a second analog for camera control, something that the portable system doesn't have. Luckily the PS3 version was compatible with the PSP save files, so I was able to play most of it much more comfortably on there.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">New Star GP</h3>
Racing / Nintendo Switch
<br><br>

New Star GP is a F1 racing game with a 3D retro aesthetic, alike _Virtua Racing_. Gameplay wise, it's first and foremost an arcade game, with some sprinkles of simulation, with semi-realistic physics, fuel and tire management and car development options. A great balance between both opposites, if you ask me.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Outrun 2006: Coast 2 Coast</h3>
Racing / PSP
<br><br>

Keeping with the racing genre, I bring now one that has nothing of simulation, it's all arcade, which makes sense since it's a reinterpretation of the original _Outrun_. Yup, it's literally that, but with more Ferrari models, more songs to choose on the radio, and a new mode with missions. Sadly the PSP version, which was the one I played, has some framerate drops here and there, but nothing that ruins the fun.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Mario Strikers: Battle League</h3>
Sports / Nintendo Switch
<br><br>

I cannot convey how much disappointed I was with _Mario Strikers: Battle League_ when it came out and I got a chance to play it - not because of what it was, but because of what it could have been. You see, the gameplay itself is absurdly good, but the problem is that without anyone to play with, it's a nothing burger. Luckily I had opportunity to revisit it recently with a friend, just to be reminded of how much fun Mario and company are in a football field.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Totally Reliable Delivery Service</h3>
Action-adventure / Nintendo Switch
<br><br>

In the same day I played Mario Strikers, I also had the opportunity to try a game that I had never heard about before. _Totally Reliable Delivery Service_, as the name suggests, is about delivering packages, but with the most broken controls and physics system you can imagine. If I was playing this alone, I would consider this game straight up terrible, but when played in co-op, it transforms into something hilarious.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Mafia: Definitive Edition</h3>
Action-adventure / Xbox Series X
<br><br>

In the beginning of the year I made a small list of games that I definitely want to play and finish this year (maybe I should do a post about it) and Mafia was one of those games. Set in a fictional city heavily based in Chicago during the 30's, Mafia tells a classic Italian-American mobster story - while not revolutionary, it's really well delivered, specially for fans of the genre such as me.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories</h3>
Action-adventure / PSP
<br><br>

Motivated by _Mafia: Definitive Edition_ and my recent watching of The Sopranos, I decided to give another shot (pun not intended) to another game heavily focused in organised crime families. I played _GTA Liberty City Stories_ halfway through a few years ago, but abandoned it after a very frustrating mission. Motivated to finish it once and for all, I transferred the save file from my PSP to an emulator on my computer so I could play it more conformably. It helped a lot, specially with the hardest missions later in the game. Sadly, it had the most anti-climatic ending of all GTA games I ever played, and I played almost all of them.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</h3>
RPG / Xbox Series X
<br><br>

Two weeks ago I had an injury that affected my left hand mobility, as such, I was unable to play any action heavy game, more specifically, the two I mentioned previously. I decided then to pick a turn based RPG, something that would be possible to play in my condition. _Yakuza: Like a Dragon_ was the game I chose. I didn't advance much in the game, as I'm still in the opening act, but I know I'm in for a good time, judging by the great reception this game had when it released.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Alentejo: Tinto's Law</h3>
Action-adventure / Game Boy
<br><br>

_Alentejo Tinto's Law_ is a Portuguese game based on the region that gives it its name, made for the Game Boy, with a physical release, in 2025. If it piqued your curiosity, check my review of it.

<br>
And that's all for the first edition of the new format of _Played this Months_, which is now bimonthly (as if it wasn't clear by now). This was a change made to not only relieve some of the self-inflicted pressure of getting this out every month, but also to make the content more interesting to read, as I didn't have much to say in some of last year's editions. See you next time!
