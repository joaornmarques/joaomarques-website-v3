In a month where my biggest achievement was [going to Gamescom](https://joaomarques.website/abxy/gamescom-24), playing games ironically have fallen a few steps in my priorities list. I finished a total of zero games in August, but was able to advance significantly in the ones I was already playing in July.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</h3>
Action-adventure / PS3
<br><br>

As I said last month, my expectations were very high, and I'm happy to report that they are being corresponded. In a gameplay perspective, it's much more balanced and forgiving than the previous two. Being set mostly in wild environments instead of more closed areas gives much more freedom to sneak through the enemies. The story is also very gripping, specially considering this game marks the beginning of the Metal Gear timeline. Can't wait to see what else the game has to offer.

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Persona</h3>
RPG / PSP
<br><br>

Playing this first Persona is being... interesting. I'm not hating it, but I'm not loving it either. The story is confusing, the characters have little to no development, the dungeons are very inconsistent and the random encounter battles are tiresome. We can see here some ideas that would later be evolved and refined into something much better in later titles, but on its own, the first Persona is rough and outdated. I'll finish it anyway, since I'm already way too invested on it, but I hope it gets better towards the end. Fingers crossed.

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Wipeout Omega Collection</h3>
Racing / PS4
<br><br>

It's a bit sad to think that Wipeout Omega Collection, from 2017, which is already a remaster of Wipeout HD Fury and Wipeout 2048 from PS3 and PS Vita respectively, is to this day the last release in this historical franchise. Luckily it's a phenomenal game (or should I say games?), running in buttery smooth 60fps and 4k visuals on a PS4 Pro, and PS5 by extension.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class="u-mt-0 u-mb-1">Valkyria Chronicles</h3>
Tactical RPG / Nintendo Switch
<br><br>

I didn't have yet much time to explore Valkyria Chronicles, but from the first few missions I had opportunity to play, I know for sure this is a game I'll absolutely love. Not only it is a turn-based tactical game with a military theme, but it also plays a fictional anime-like rendition of World War II's european theatre. It's a bit weird, I assume, but not using the real countries names and geography it's probably for the best. I also want to mention the absolutely epic [main theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP9rJdxmuQU) of the game, that sets perfectly the mood for what's to come.
