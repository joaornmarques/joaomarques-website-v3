Saying that Cyberpunk 2077 had a terrible launch is an understatement. Back in late 2020, when the public finally got the chance to play it after several delays and an unsustainable hype surrounding it, they found a completely broken game. The case was particularly bad in the PS4 and Xbox One versions.

Hi, welcome to ABXY, my personal blog about gaming, or a journal, or whatever you call a place where you can read content about gaming. In case you don’t know who I am, let me put you up to speed. 
<br><br>
I’m João, but most friends call me Chari (from Charizard, the Pokémon, it’s a long story). Videogames were always a special thing for me, even though I grown up in an environment that was quite dismissive of them. This appreciation wasn’t something inherited, even I can’t explain exactly how it happened, but I may point out my appreciation for every kind of visual media from early age as a strong reason. 
<br><br>
Nowdays I came to the conclusion that this is more than a hobby for me, as so, I decided to start writing about the games I play, not only tho share my views on them with everyone interested, but also to document my journey.

    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Ordered

2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:
