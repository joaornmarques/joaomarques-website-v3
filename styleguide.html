          <p class="u-ts-2">So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning.</p>
          <p class="u-ts-3">I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Poor old tree. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. At home you have unlimited time.</p>
          <p class="u-ts-3">Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue.</p>
          <p class="u-ts-4">Let's make a nice big leafy tree. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Don't fiddle with it all day.</p>
          <p class="u-ts-4">Nothing wrong with washing your brush. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. Do an almighty painting with us. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about.</p>
          <p class="u-ts-5">We don't have anything but happy trees here. See there how easy that is. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. This is a fantastic little painting. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do.</p>
