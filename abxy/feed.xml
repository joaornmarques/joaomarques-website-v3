I wasn’t expecting to have already five posts in such short time period, but here we are. Anyway, thank you for reading my stuff, regardless of if you read everything so far or if you just found this humble blog.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s now focus on today’s topic: What have I been playing during this year. Not a lot to be honest, comparing at least with previous ones, if we consider only game variety. It was a year where I invested a lot of time into western and japanese RPGs, genres notorious for their lengthy narratives and all kinds of griding activities. No wonder I didn’t have time for much else. In a year jam-packed with fantastic releases (some may argue it was one of the best years ever in that regard), very few ended in on my 2023 playthrough. Only three new titles, with two of them being remasters or remakes, had my attention during this last 12 months. However, there are still a few games released this year I want to play, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqpbMLVa9EI&quot;&gt;Pikmin 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtDNA_kiZ4&quot;&gt;Fire Emblem Engage&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully, next year I will be talking about them right here.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Without further ado, here are all the games I finished this year, listed by finishing date:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;March 7th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Persona 5 Royal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RPG / PS4 / 132 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persona 5 Royal consumed a gigantic amount of my time during the first months of the year. Even though is a japanese RPG, the game (and by extension the whole series) stays away from the typical medieval or dystopic fantasies, with the action occouring on a current day Tokyo setting, which make the characters more relatable and the lenghty story more gripping. This was by far the biggest single player game I ever played. Luckily it was also an absolute masterpiece, recieving the distinction of &lt;strong&gt;my favourite of the entire year&lt;/strong&gt;. As so, I will give it a full review soon.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ The Persona surreal universe exists between dream and reality, mind and matter.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;March 25th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Metroid Prime Remastered&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action-adventure / Nintendo Switch / 25 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a surprise this remaster was. The Gamecube original was already a masterpiece, reinventing the Metroidvania subgenre in a 3D first-person perspective, and yet Retro Studios (the developer behind it) managed to improve the few flaws the game had, turning it into something truly perfect. It’s no exaggeration to say that Metroid Prime Remastered is one of the best looking games in the Nintendo Switch library.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;March 26th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Grid Legends&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racing / PS4 / 9 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like racing games that deliver some plot and Grid Legends promised exactly that, with a campaign following a structure heavily influenced by the Netflix series &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEY3Q43aE_c&quot;&gt;Formula 1 Drive to Survive&lt;/a&gt;. We play as a rookie for the underdog team, obviously, during two seasons of the fictional Grid Series, and between races we are presented with some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlNWdYkR-TE&quot;&gt;cutscenes&lt;/a&gt; in a behind the scenes documental style, where we are introduced to the members of our team and some rivals. Sadly the campaign end up feeling a bit short and the rest of the content isn’t nearly as interesting. At least the few hours I spent with it were quite enjoyable.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;April 20th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Marvel’s Spider-Man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action-adventure / PS4 / 25 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never had much interest in superheroes, but if I had to mention my favourite I would say Spider-Man. That alone raised my consideration for this Marvel’s Spider-Man, but even if we ignore the iconic web slinger, this is a great action game. Although, after a couple hours, the game starts to be a tad repetitive. I must admit that I was expecting a bit more variety from it, considering the high acclaims it had on its release. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;May 31th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Advance Wars 1+2: Reboot Camp&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn-based strategy / Nintendo Switch / 45 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advance Wars 2 was one of THE games of my childhood, as so, when I saw the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fftL_XeK2qU&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of its remake (alongside its predecessor), I knew it was a day one purchase for me. All things considered it was an extremely faithful remake, gameplay wise. The biggest difference laid on the new art style. The toy box aesthetic wasn’t my favourite, must admit, but it had grown on me. Nonetheless, behind the cartoonish aspect, this are two of the best-turn based strategy games ever made, rolled into a sleek package.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;July 12th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action-adventure / Nintendo Switch / 90 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tears of the Kingdom was the game I was most eager to play this year and it’s safe to say that it didn’t disappointed, even considering the unreasonably high expectations upon its release. It was bigger and better than its predecessor in almost every aspect. Although this time around the surprise factor wasn’t as huge as with Breath of the Wild. Nonetheless, it was still &lt;strong&gt;my second favourite game of the year&lt;/strong&gt;. This one will also receive a full review here later on.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ The scope of Hyrule is bigger than ever in Tears of the Kingdom.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;August 15th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action-adventure / Nintendo 3DS / 28 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right, I played two Zelda titles in a row. Well, actually, I had an abandoned save file on my 3DS and finally got the motivation to finish it once and for all. I now understand why Ocarina of Time is one of the most acclaimed games of all time, being a timeless epic adventure.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;September 8th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action RPG / PS4 / 66 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may not know, but I already wrote a review for this game. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/abxy/cyberpunk-2077&quot;&gt;check it here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;October 11th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Metroid Prime 2: Echoes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action-adventure / Nintendo Gamecube / 20 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metroid Prime 2 is centered around two parallel worlds, one of light and other of darkness. Not a novel concept, but one always with huge potential. In theory it seemed like a fantastic idea, but unfortunately made the game unecessarly repetitive. It certainly didn’t help that the entire dark world was engulfed in a purple mist, making it very unpleasant to look after a few hours. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a very good game, but I didn’t liked it nearly as much as its predecessor.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;October 28th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racing / PS4 / 36 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GT7 is one of those titles where the experience changes dramatically depending on the input used. It plays fine with a controller, but with a proper racing wheel and pedals this game takes on a whole new life. It’s by far the best racing experience I’ve had at home. The only problem with it is the extremely aggressive monetization. Some cars are prohibitively expensive just to encourage players to buy them with real life money, or grind to death for the necessary credits. Otherwise, how would I put my hands into the legendary &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/tI-fR5USR2M?si=24d4ctrmafvdZ4Rn&amp;amp;t=20&quot;&gt;McLaren MP4/4&lt;/a&gt;?
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;November 12th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Persona 4 Golden&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RPG / Nintendo Switch / 93 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After enjoying Persona 5 so much, my interest for the whole series sparked almost immediately. So, logically I decided to explore its previous main entry. While similar in its gameplay structure, Persona 4 setting and story are much more intimate, with the main narrative focusing on a serial murder case in a small japanese town. With no surprise it turned out to be &lt;strong&gt;my third favourite game of the year&lt;/strong&gt;, completing my podium of favourite games of 2023. Just like Persona 5 Royal and Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, Persona 4 Golden will also receive a full review on this very blog.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ While not as stylish as its successor, Persona 4 strength lies in its charming setting and characters.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;December 16th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Fallout 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action-RPG / Xbox 360 / 42 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first Fallout game I ever played and the first Bethesda Game Studios game I ever finished. I already spent some time with Skyrim in the past, but got myself distracted with the endless side quests. This time I forced myself to not steer too much away from the main story. Soon I realised that the main story of Fallout 3 wasn’t all that great, apart from an amazing mission involving a virtual reality. What makes this game truly special is all the smaller side stories happening all around the wasteland and the freedom we have to determine their resolution.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;December 24th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Panzer Dragoon: Remake&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rail shooter / Nintendo Switch / 2h
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To close the year I played the first game in one of Sega’s most underrated series, Panzer Dragoon, in its remade version. While the visuals were completely overhauled to make justice to the amazing art direction of the original, the gameplay remained intact, apart from an optional new control scheme. Also worth noting is the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3nkw7RTcsM&quot;&gt;reimagined soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;, making it stylistically closer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/CJBYS-3SqHE?si=UfQfYwRfDvZwEmWt&amp;amp;t=1091&quot;&gt;sound of its sequel&lt;/a&gt; (that for me is the absolute best in the series).
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And that’s all! As I mentioned before, you can expect reviews of the three games I enjoyed the most in 2023, &lt;strong&gt;Persona 5 Royal&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kindgom&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Persona 4 Golden&lt;/strong&gt;, here at ABXY. See you next year!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="update" /><summary type="html">We now reach the end of 2023 and with that the end of the first month of activity of ABXY. I wasn’t expecting to have already five posts in such short time period, but here we are. Anyway, thank you for reading my stuff, regardless of if you read everything so far or if you just found this humble blog. Let’s now focus on today’s topic: What have I been playing during this year. Not a lot to be honest, comparing at least with previous ones, if we consider only game variety.

However, there are still a few games released this year I want to play, like Pikmin 4 and Fire Emblem Engage. Hopefully, next year I will be talking about them right here. Without further ado, here are all the games I finished this year, listed by finishing date:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Winners and Losers of The Game Awards 2023</title><link href="https://joaomarques.website/abxy/the-game-awards-2023" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Winners and Losers of The Game Awards 2023" /><published>2023-12-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://joaomarques.website/abxy/the-game-awards-2023</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://joaomarques.website/abxy/the-game-awards-2023">&lt;p&gt;Beside the usual festive season, the end of the year is now also marked by a more recent tradition, The Game Awards. This event was initially created in 2014 by the gaming journalist Geoff Keighley to award the best games released each year, but has steadily grown to be more of a showcase for announcements of the upcoming ones, mixed with a considerable amount of related advertisement, absorbing some of the mediatic space left by the now (probably) defunct E3. It’s safe to say that TGA is by now one of the most important events in this media, with a viewership of 103 millions in 2022, according to the organisation. As so, everyone is interested in having a small piece the three and half hours of the ceremony’s runtime, from the small indie studios to the big names. There’s a bit of everything in here.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But let’s focus on what happened during this year’s edition. Who came out on top and who or what were the biggest disappointments? Let’s find out by nominating the winners and losers of the The Game Awards 2023.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;winners&quot;&gt;Winners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;baldurs-gate-3&quot;&gt;Baldur’s Gate 3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no way to deny it, Baldur’s Gate 3 was the indisputable winner of this year, claiming 6 awards in 9 nominations, including Game Of The Year. This feat was even more impressive if we consider the quality of the other nominees in every category it claimed, being this one of the most competitive years ever. I personally didn’t played it as I’m not that invested in Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons (in which this game is based of), but I believe all the acclaim was deserved. After all, it was arguably the best-received game this year, being truly consensual among critics and fans.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alan-wake-2&quot;&gt;Alan Wake 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other game that collected a nice amount of little statues, with 3 awards in 8 nominations. Curiously, Alan Wake 2 was announced to the public precisely at The Game Awards, two years prior. Surely a must play for fans of survival horror.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sega&quot;&gt;Sega&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who would have thought that Sega would have the best announcement of this TGA? I didn’t, even thought they teased it a few days before. Sega has a precedent of overpromising and underdelivering, so I was cautious. Surprisingly this time the hype was justified. They announced FIVE new titles at once, from their repertoire of dormant franchises: Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Streets of Rage, Shinobi and Golden Axe. As a long time Sega fan, it’s impossible to not be excited with this. The only problem I saw was the fact they mentioned that this games were “now in development”, which means that we probably won’t see them anytime soon. One or two may come out later in 2024, but my hopes are low. To be fair, I don’t mind to wait. Kudos also to Atlus (which Sega owns), for showing new trailers for the two games I’m most eager to play next year: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4py4V5xwXWE&quot;&gt;Persona 3 Reload&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4bGNzXnKak&quot;&gt;Metaphor: ReFantazio&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;c-post__video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0VHYLJR9pNg&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ The trailer was a bit cheesy, but the games revealed look promising.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hideo-kojima&quot;&gt;Hideo Kojima&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s well known that the mastermind behind Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding has a good relationship with Geoff Keighley, which grants him a free pass to use TGA as its own marketing platform. At this point it would be a surprise to not see him on stage talking during several minutes about an upcoming project without showing anything substantial about it. This year we were presented with a game called “OD”, with the only thing shown being a tech demo of a few face animations. It was weird, in classic Kojima fashion. I don’t know if it was a win for the public in general, but for him it was for sure. See you next year Kojima-san.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;honorable-mention&quot;&gt;Honorable Mention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nintendo&quot;&gt;Nintendo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With little to no presence during the event, Nintendo managed to sneakily snag 3 awards: Best Action / Adventure Game (The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom), Best Family Game (Super Mario Bros. Wonder) and Best Sim / Strategy Game (Pikmin 4), in a total of 15 nominations. A fair reward considering the great year they had in terms of releases. Regarding the future, Nintendo didn’t unveil the curtain, although their 2024 looks pretty slim so far. Probably not the right time for announcements, as they might have bigger fish to fry with their imminent upcoming system.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;losers&quot;&gt;Losers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;marvels-spider-man-2&quot;&gt;Marvel’s Spider Man 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony’s sole horse for the silverware race lost in a spectacular way, taking home a staggering amount of zero awards, in 7 nominations. It was unfortunate, as the game actually looks good and should be fun to play, taking in consideration my knowledge of its predecessor. However, it was outclassed in every category it was nominated for. As I said before, this was a very competitive year and Spider Man 2 ended up being the colateral damage.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;starfield&quot;&gt;Starfield&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was already known that Starfield wouldn’t be in the discussion for a huge amount of awards, as it wasn’t even nominated for Game of the Year, but considering it was one of the most anticipated games of 2023, it’s disappointing to see Xbox and Bethesda’s newest crown jewel relegated to second plan, recieveing a single nomination for Best Role Playing Game. Even there it had the misfortue of encounter and lose to the inevitable Baldur’s Gate 3. Can’t say it was unfair, since the game’s reception was mixed overall, but Todd Howard surely must be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyL5kKW5xAo&quot;&gt;a bit disapointed&lt;/a&gt; with this outcome. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;every-award-winner-on-stage&quot;&gt;Every award winner on stage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year during the winning speech for Best Performance, Christopher Judge, who portrayed Kratos in God of War Ragnarök, caught everyone by surprise by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij0VUU6L1io&amp;amp;t=255s&quot;&gt;speaking uninterruptedly for eight minutes&lt;/a&gt;. It was clear that even the production wasn’t aware of what was happening back then, because this year they overcompensated for that little detour. This time around each award winner had no more than a single minute to deliver their speech before having a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/javierabegazo/status/1732975428237934964&quot;&gt;“Please wrap it up”&lt;/a&gt; message on the teleprompter. The Game Awards always had problems in balancing the show between the awards itself and the promotional side, with the balance tending more and more in favour of the later as the years go by. I would be lying if I said that I don’t care about those announcements, but to put in perspective, any of the several ads for Lego Fortnite or Honkai: Star Rail that ran during the event lasted longer than any winner speech.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
From the few interesting announcements, to the winners trimmed speeches, passing by the countless unnecessary ads (I know Lego Fortnite is a thing FFS, I saw the first ad), The Game Awards 2023 was a complete mixed bag. I hope Geoff takes his lessons from this year and turn this event into something truly great, because the potential is already there. Or probably give 20 minutes on stage to each winner to compensate for the overcompensation.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="opinion" /><summary type="html">Beside the usual festive season, the end of the year is now also marked by a more recent tradition, The Game Awards. This event was initially created in 2014 by the gaming journalist Geoff Keighley to award the best games released each year, but has steadily grown to be more of a showcase for announcements of the upcoming ones, mixed with a considerable amount of related advertisement, absorbing some of the mediatic space left by the now (probably) defunct E3. It’s safe to say that TGA is by now one of the most important events in this media, with a viewership of 103 millions in 2022, according to the organisation. As so, everyone is interested in having a small piece the three and half hours of the ceremony’s runtime, from the small indie studios to the big names. There’s a bit of everything in here. But let’s focus on what happened during this year’s edition. Who came out on top and who or what were the biggest disappointments? Let’s find out by nominating the winners and losers of the The Game Awards 2023.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Cyberpunk 2077</title><link href="https://joaomarques.website/abxy/cyberpunk-2077" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cyberpunk 2077" /><published>2023-12-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://joaomarques.website/abxy/cyberpunk-2077</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://joaomarques.website/abxy/cyberpunk-2077">&lt;p&gt;Saying that Cyberpunk 2077 had a terrible launch is an understatement. Back in late 2020, when the public finally got the chance to play it after several delays and an unsustainable hype surrounding it, they found a completely broken game. Not only it was a farcry from what the developers CD Projekt Red had promissed during all the years since the game was announced, but it was filled with a myriad of technical issues. The case was particularly bad with the PS4 and Xbox One versions, to the point of Sony removing it from their digital store until it reached a “playable” state.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I was one of the persons eager to play the game back then, but all the chaos surrounding it made me forget that idea, until recently. After find the PS4 version at a very good price, I decided to give it a chance and see by myself if it was still as broken, after a few years and countless bug fixing patches.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-this-a-rpg&quot;&gt;Is this a RPG?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a first glance, Cyberpunk 2077 may look like a futuristic Grand Theft Auto, as it was my expectation before playing it, but right from the beggining we understand that it isn’t quite the case. We play as a mercenary named “V”, that can be fully customized to our preference. The game even give us the option to choose one of three distinct backgrounds for our character. Sadly this only changes the early part of the game and a few extra dialog options. But nothing that took my enjoyment from the main plot, that opens in a fantastic way. It goes like this:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our protagonist, V, is requested to steal an experimental biochip (that is essentially a cyberware implant) during one of their mercenary gigs. While most of the heist went relatively smooth, things turned for worse after they retrieve the chip, being ambushed by its owner’s security. While trying to escape, the chip protection case got damaged, with the only way for V to avoid its degradation being to insert it in their own body. They soon realise that the chip actually contained a soul of a deceased person ready to appropriate V’s body, erasing their own soul in the process. The person in question is Johnny Silverhand, portrayed by Keanu Reeves. From this point, the narrative focus on this mental struggle between two souls fighting over one body, with Silverhand appearing randomly in hallucinations, and in some cases taking full control for a brief moment.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I admit it was quite difficult to summarise the prologue, because there’s much more to it than this, but I don’t want to spoil everything to you. Actually, it was the density of this story and characters dialogs that made me realise that this was far from just an action game, or a shooter. At the same time, everything had a more steamlined feeling than your typical western RPG (comparing for example with any Bethesda Game Studios title). I usually get a bit overwhelmed when I have too many options to choose from, as so, for me Cyberpunk 2077 hit the right balance between linearity and freedom.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With all that said, beside the main story, there are several side quests worth exploring. Usually they are focused on specific characters or groups and span across multiple missions. Each side quest helps you to better understand the complex dynamic of Night City, the place where all this takes place. There are multiple factions fighting for their turf, corporation wars, all new kinds of addictions, and the cherry on top, a completely inefficient police department. The perfect recipe for a chaotic city full of friends, as long as your interests match theirs, and foes, ready to be decimated by a weapon of your choice.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-beauty-in-night-city&quot;&gt;The beauty in Night City&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is one department where this game absolutely nails the park is the visuals. Every corner of Night City is very detailed and full of colourful neons. There is a certain joy to just wandering around the city during nighttime in a fast car, while listening some Lo-fi beats on &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/5r149kHSZvI?si=BaBXCwo8aheh2_Bu&amp;amp;t=657&quot;&gt;Pacific Dreams&lt;/a&gt;, one of the many radio stations with music composed specifically for this game. Even the areas outside the city itself, while not so dense in buildings and population, are visually stunning as well. Speaking on density, there lies the biggest issue with this game when played on Xbox One or PS4, as it was my case.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ This mission is the best showcase of Cyberpunk 2077 great graphics and art direction.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-generational-problem&quot;&gt;A generational problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, Xbox One and PS4 were still pretty much alive, while its successors were still suffering from huge stock shortages. It made sense to release this game on both back then. Although, beside the bugs common to every platform, new and old, there was an underlying issue carved into the game core design that impeded it to perform well on those consoles. They were equipped by default with good ol’ HDD hard drives. What’s the issue with that, you ask? You see, those drives are very, very slow compared to the now standard SSDs. While navigating around the visually complex Night City, the game often freezes during a few seconds for the hard drive to catch up and load all the necessary assets to render everything visible to the eye. Of course this wasn’t an issue if the drive was fast enough to provide those assets on the fly. Luckily, there is a very obvious solution: upgrading the console’s HDD to a SSD. It makes a world of difference. With this setup, you can have a perfectly playable version of this incredible game on a system with 2013 specs. That on itself is a miracle.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There is an elephant in the room though. This old systems didn’t received the latest 2.0 upgrade that revisioned some core game mechanics, neither the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyberpunk.net/us/en/phantom-liberty&quot;&gt;Phantom Liberty&lt;/a&gt; expansion, so you will miss some content just like I did if the last-gen Xbox or Playstation consoles are your only options. But I assure you that even without that, Cyberpunk 2077 is totally worth playing, now that it’s a polished product.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engaging and complex main story&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Side quests worth of exploring&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Night City is visually impressive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Futuristic soundtrack fits really well in this universe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A SSD upgrade is a “must have” to play it on last-gen consoles
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;great&quot;&gt;Great&lt;span class=&quot;u-ft-sans&quot;&gt;✦✦✦✦✧&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All things considered, Cyberpunk 2077 is an amazing and unforgetable experience that deserves its ongoing redemption story.

Just like in every other type of media review, there isn’t a single kind of content that can drive so much excitement, or ire (mostly ire), of the rabid fans of the piece subjected to scrutiny. No review is perfect or the source of universal truth, as everyone has their biases, including the people whose job is to write them. I also have my own bias, but in my case nobody pays me to write reviews, so I have no lobbies to please. I can guarantee you that at least.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how I will rate each game I review? That’s the question that nobody asked, but I will answer regardless. I’m not interested in complex rating systems, with decimal points, or scores for each aspect of the game. I find quite difficult to associate numbers to an experience in a logical way, so I will associate stars instead, just like this: ✦✧✧✧✧. This is an example of a 1 out of 5 star review, that in its essence is a numbered rating and invalidates everything I said so far. But at least, with only five rating tiers, I can correlate a specific feeling to each one of them. Which feelings you may ask? Allow me to explain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bad&quot;&gt;Bad&lt;span class=&quot;u-ft-sans&quot;&gt;✦✧✧✧✧&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is somewhat obvious. This rating is for the kind of game that I didn’t enjoyed at all, but it still had some redeeming quality, as little as it could be comparing with all the other major issues, that pushed me at least to finish it. Otherwise I would simply drop it after a few minutes, without even considering writing a review about it. A game worth of this rating is &lt;strong&gt;Sonic R&lt;/strong&gt;. Its gameplay is absolutely hideous, but it was graced with one of the best soundtracks in the entire series.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ Right from the title screen you can tell the music is good.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;okay&quot;&gt;Okay&lt;span class=&quot;u-ft-sans&quot;&gt;✦✦✧✧✧&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is reserved for games that weren’t that obnoxiously bad or frustrating, but didn’t went anywhere particularly interesting or new, falling in the land of mediocrity. One relatively recent example of that is &lt;strong&gt;Mario Strikers: Battle League Football&lt;/strong&gt;. A game that looks and plays fine, but it isn’t captivating in the slightest, doing little to keep the players invested, either in single player or online.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;good&quot;&gt;Good&lt;span class=&quot;u-ft-sans&quot;&gt;✦✦✦✧✧&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle of the road. Now the subject was something far from bad, but still a few steps away of excellence. This are the kind of games that were entertaining during their playthrough, but lacked that special factor that elevate them to an unforgetable experience. For me, &lt;strong&gt;Marvel’s Spider Man&lt;/strong&gt; encapsulates well this feeling. A game with a sublime gameplay but a not so interesting plot or variety of things to do.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;c-post__video&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ Web slinging around New York feels admittedly satisfying.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;great&quot;&gt;Great&lt;span class=&quot;u-ft-sans&quot;&gt;✦✦✦✦✧&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are talking seriously. Even if it’s not the highest rating, for a game to be “great”, it needs to get near perfection. But yet, a great game may lacks in some specific aspects that prevent them to reach that level. I experienced that with &lt;strong&gt;Mirror’s Edge&lt;/strong&gt;. The concept, music and artstyle were incredible, but the execution wasn’t refined enough.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pinnacle of entertainment. This rating is reserved to games that I may consider my favourites of all time. Note that they might not be perfect for everyone, or even perfect on a technical standpoint, but they are perfect to me. &lt;strong&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/strong&gt; is my most immediate example of a masterpice. I cannot even describe it in one sentence.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe “blog” is an outdated term, let’s call it an independent publication instead. Anyway, in case you don’t know who I am, let me put you up to speed.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I’m João, but most friends call me Chari. Videogames were always a special thing for me, even though that sentiment wasn’t shared by anyone in my family, who only saw them as way to waste time, or even an addiction. This appreciation wasn’t something inherited, even I can’t quite explain exactly how it happened, but I may point out my interest for every kind of visual and interactive media as a strong reason. It was not by chance that I became a designer and developer.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Eventually my interest for the media had grown beside just playing the games. I become interested in knowing the history, the latest news and even how the industry worked. It was by then that I came to the conclusion that for me, gaming was more than a hobby. As so, I decided to start writing about the topic. My intention is obviously to share my views on them with everyone interested, but also to document my playthroughs, for sake of my own memory.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-can-you-expect-from-abxy&quot;&gt;What can you expect from ABXY?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviews&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My main focus will be on reviewing games that I finish, considering most I play are single player. Don’t expect the most recent ones reviewed during its release window though, you have IGN, Gamespot and many other outlets for that. It can happen occasionally though, but even if I get a game on day one, I’m not going to torture myself with a speedrun just to write about it. New games are expensive, it’s a waste to rush them.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Monthly updates&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the end of each month I’ll do a quick recap of everything I played during that period. It will be something more brief, in form of first impressions or progress report for each game.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Opinions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lastly, I also want to do some opinion articles, but more sporadically. I’ll only do this if I feel that I have something interesting, or funny, to say regarding the topics in question.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is my vision for ABXY. If it’s going to be exactly like I described it? I have no idea, but I hope you and the other few ones who end up here reading my rambles at least find them entertaining.
