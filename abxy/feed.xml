The world was different back then, as Nintendo itself. Nowadays it seems almost unthinkable, but the house of Mario was in serious trouble before the release of the hybrid system that revolutionised the gaming market and gave a whole new life to portable systems. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s look back at the inception of the Nintendo Switch, how it became so successful and what it still has left to give.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nintendos-ace-in-the-hole&quot;&gt;Nintendo’s ace in the hole&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying that Nintendo had a few rough years before the release of the Switch is quite an understatement. After the staggering success of the Wii, the company decided to release its successor, the Wii U, in 2012. Although, its confusing proposition, baffling name and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3qaPg_keg&quot;&gt;terrible marketing&lt;/a&gt; caused it to flop hard. For “hardcore” gamers, it wasn’t powerful enough to deliver the third party games present on the other systems (which was already a problem with the original Wii), and the “casual” audience didn’t even understand that Wii U was actually a new system, neither needed one (as most of them only played Wii Sports anyway). Even the relative success of the Nintendo 3DS wasn’t enough to compensate for the huge financial losses caused by this misstep. As a consequence of that, the company’s president Satoru Iwata famously cut his salary in half to avoid layoffs, a move that made him be in good graces of many fans, alongside his charisma and genuine passion for gaming. Unsurprisingly, his death in 2015 was another hard blow in Nintendo’s already low spirits.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everything was doom and gloom though, with the development of the next system being already underway. In that same year the first news about it surfaced, while the full reveal only happened one year later, in 2016. It was undoubtedly a smart move. Nintendo always had a strong grasp on the portable gaming market, so, an hybrid system like the Switch was the logical step in hindsight. Instead of supporting two systems simultaneously, like it happened before (the 3DS still coexisted with the Switch for a couple of years, but it was quickly phased out), they could combine all their efforts on a single platform. Of course there were still concerns about the system modest specs, as it could fall in the same pattern of not getting third party multi-platform games due the disparity with the other available systems. Luckily the Nintendo Switch was a success right out of the box when it launched, in March 3 2017, in due part to their &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; ace in the hole.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ The Nintendo Switch was introduced to the world with this trailer, back in late 2016.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-all-about-the-games&quot;&gt;It’s all about the games&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lineup of games available on launch day was nothing to write home about, but it didn’t matter. The highly anticipated The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was the most compelling argument to get the Switch day one. The game was so successful that not only revolutionised the Zelda franchise, but the entire open-world genre. While it was also released simultaneously for the Wii U, it was more out of obligation its loyal user base, since it was developed with that system in mind to begin with.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Breath of the Wild was enough to keep the new Switch owners busy for a few weeks (if not months), but the first year of the console would see an influx of great exclusive releases, such as Splatoon 2, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Super Mario Odyssey. By the end of 2017, it was clear that the Switch was here to stay. With a good user base and the novelty of playing on TV or on the go, third party developers interest grew substantially. The efforts put in ports like Skyrim, The Witcher 3, Doom or Dark Souls proved that there was market for this kind of re-releases. The graphical downgrade was a compromise many people were willing to accept, with the prospect of having the flexibility of playing this games on a portable form factor. The indie scene was (and still is) also a force to be reckoned with in the Switch library. Since those games usually aren’t as graphically demanding as high budget ones, they are released on Nintendo’s system without compromises, making the Switch the ideal place to play them.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In my case, what made me jump to the Switch bandwagon was the release of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, in late 2018. I was already a fan of the series, so, when Ultimate was announced with the promisse of including all the characters from the previous entries, I knew it was time to get a Switch. Sadly I had to wait a few months to play it, since the physical edition of the game was sold out everywhere during that holiday season. Instead I ended up picking Super Mario Odyssey as my first Switch game. Case to say that I had no regrets with that decision, because it was absolutely fantastic! It became instantly my favourite Mario game.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;c-post__video&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ The game reveal that made me buy a Switch back in the day.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;something-called-animal-crossing&quot;&gt;Something called Animal Crossing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Switch concept was more than solidified to the gaming audience, it wasn’t until the release of Animal Crossing: New Horizons that the system had its breakout moment with the casual public. Animal Crossing was a life simulation series where the player could live a parallel life with cute anthropomorphic animals, following the real life time and calendar. After a few years of hiatus, the fans were eager for the series return. The concept of this new entry, titled New Horizons, was to move to a deserted island and developing it with cultivations, houses, infrastructures and more, while creating relationships with the few animals who choose to live there as well. The game looked great and promissed a ton of content, judging by the trailers revealed until then. The hype machine was building up for the game release in March of 2020. I don’t know if you remember by now, but there was &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; global trend that started to grow insanely that same month. Covid-19 forced many of us to obligatory lockdowns and many people started looking into forms of escapism to deal with the situation. What could be more enticing than living a nice life in a island far away from all the real world problems?
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
From that point onwards sales of the system and software skyrocketed and a new wave of games appeared trying to appeal to this new audience interested in farming simulators and “cozy” games. The Switch truly felt like a system for everyone.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;c-post__video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ie4WZCLbtVs&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ Animal Crossing: New Horizons success is one of the best examples of right place, right time.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fading-into-the-sunset&quot;&gt;Fading into the sunset&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything good eventually comes to an end, as is the case with the Switch. While 2023 was still an incredible year in terms of new releases, (Super Mario Wonder, &lt;a href=&quot;https://joaomarques.website/abxy/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom&quot;&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://joaomarques.website/abxy/pikmin-4&quot;&gt;Pikmin 4&lt;/a&gt;, to name a few), 2024 looks much more bleak in contrast. Most of the exclusive titles of this year are essentially remakes and remasters, some justifiable (Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door), others not really (Mario vs Donkey Kong). Having the knowledge to make an educated guess, I say this is a clear sign that the main development efforts are being put somewhere else, very likely in a new system. This statement can age either like wine or milk, but I’m truly confident that this will be the last year of the Switch as the main Nintendo system, with the reveal of the next one not very far away.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It’s impossible to know for sure what’s going to happen next, but nobody can take from us the seven years of the tiny gaming tablet (yes, it has a touchscreen, even if few games used it) that served as home for some of the finest games ever made.

I’m fully aware that this blog is one step short of transforming into a Persona Fan Club, but that’s a risk I’m willing to take. Anyway, I still had time to play a few other things. Here’s what February looked like:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Persona 3 Reload&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RPG / PS4
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one was a given. As soon as the remake of the third Persona game was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIIPXA2A6cM&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;, with new visuals and quality-of-life improvements brought from Persona 5, I knew it was a day one purchase for me. My time with this game so far has been great, with around 20 hours clocked in. I’m still relatively in the beginning of the story, as nothing really interesting happened yet, but the combat and character development are keeping me engaged so far.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hack’n’slash / Nintendo Switch
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a week away from home (and from Persona 3 Reload), as so I took the opportunity to bring the Switch with me and play a short game from my backlog, with No More Heroes 2 being the chosen one. You can already read &lt;a href=&quot;https://joaomarques.website/abxy/no-more-heroes-2&quot;&gt;my review of it&lt;/a&gt;, in case you didn’t yet.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Metal Gear Solid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action-adventure / PS1
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To close the month, I decided to finally dive into Hideo Kojima’s best-known series. While in the beginning I struggled a bit to truly understand the game mechanics, now I’m completely hooked. It’s hard to believe this game is 25 years old, with the only evidence of that being the charming PS1 polygonal graphics.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And that’s all for February. Not a lot of games, but the few ones were really worth my time. For next month, expect more Persona and more Metal Gear Solid. See you next time!

Brainchild of the extravagant game designer Goichi Suda (AKA Suda51), No More Heroes is heavily characterized by a mix of over-the-top violence, a self-aware sense of humor, and a ton of references and homages to other games and movies. Imagine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wd5KEaOtm4&quot;&gt;Scott Pilgrim&lt;/a&gt;, but with much more blood and censurable language.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While not published by Nintendo, this series is somewhat associated with their systems, as the two first games were designed around the Wii, and the third one around the Nintendo Switch. It was precisely with the third installment that I discovered this series, as it was revealed during a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91HU_mc9cts&quot;&gt;Nintendo Direct&lt;/a&gt;. I started my journey with No More Heroes with its first game though, to get some knowledge of the lore and characters. But after that, in a hurry to play the newest game, I decided to completely ignore the second one. I must admit I didn’t regret that decision, as I absolutely loved No More Heroes III, despite its flaws.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For a long time, I had no interest in playing No More Heroes 2, as I was almost sure I wouldn’t like it as much as its successor, but now, almost two years later, I finally decided to give it a chance. It turns out my assumption was right, but I still had a good time with it.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ranking-up-by-revenge&quot;&gt;Ranking up by revenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first No More Heroes we play as Travis Touchdown, a professional assassin with a unique taste for wrestling and anime, that’s challanged by a girl to climb up to the first rank of the UAA (United Assassins Association) in order to have a chance with her. That’s it, that’s the premisse.
And how exactly does the process of ranking up works? With deadly one-on-one matches with each ranked assassin. After reaching the number one rank and ending up without the girl, as she decides to not honor her part of the deal, Travis decides to retire from the “business”. All is good until his best friend is killed by revenge for someone Travis killed before. Coincidently, the person who plots this assassination is now the new number one of the UAA ranking.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is with this renewed motivation that Travis Touchdown decides to rank up once again, marking the start of No More Heroes 2. Unlike the first game, where he started ranked 11th, he’s now ranked at a distant 51st place. While initially it’s assumed that we would need to do 50 battles to get our desired revenge, we soon realize that the game defies our expectations by killing off more than half of those assassins off-screen during the course of the story at the most unexpected times. By the end of the game we end up actually fighting, and killing, 15 of those assassins.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking on combat, that’s the aspect that had the biggest improvement comparing with its predecessor. While in the first game the combat relied mostly on counter-attacks, making it a waiting game most of the times, this one gives more freedom to approach the enemies, be it by brute force, hit and run, or still by counter-attack.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;c-post__video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Timu1cp9zh0&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ One of the many ranking battles we face during the game.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-more-side-jobs&quot;&gt;No more side jobs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important part of this series uniqueness lies in everything else we do beside fighting. Unfortunately that’s where in my opinion No More Heroes 2 fumbles the most. In the other games we are somewhat forced to do random jobs to have money to pay the ranked battles entry fees, with those jobs ranging from minor killing sprees to some mundane tasks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEIkr5RceJQ&quot;&gt;lawn mowing or unclogging toilets&lt;/a&gt;. It’s ridiculous for sure, but that’s the point. It’s satirical.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are still side jobs in No More Heroes 2, but they are presented in an 8-bit style this time around. They are mildly fun, but mostly useless. Unlike on the other two games, here there are no entry fees for the ranked battles, as so, the money can only be used to buy new clothes, weapons and going to the gym (to upgrade life and attack power). But even considering the gym upgrades, which are in fact useful, there is no need to hustle for extra cash, as we can gather enough just by going through the ranked battles. Buying weapons isn’t necessary as well, especially when the best one is given to Travis during the course of the story. The game can be entirely played without even interacting with this extra content, as it doesn’t even have a freely explorable hub world, being replaced by a simple menu.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;c-post__video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vsVFxY2S1o4&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ All the side jobs plays like a NES game.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All things considered, nothing in No More Heroes 2 is actually bad, but the decision to cut the open world exploration (that made its comeback on No More Heroes III) and the battle entry fees made a huge part of the game completely redundant. I still did every side job anyway, but they just felt like a mini-game compilation attached without rhyme or reason to a good hack’n’slash game.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refined hack’n’slash mechanics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nonsense story is backed by its unique sense of humor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most ranked battles are epic and incredibly fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Almost all side content is pretty much pointless&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lack of open world exploration
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;good&quot;&gt;Good&lt;span class=&quot;u-ft-sans&quot;&gt;✦✦✦✧✧&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No More Heroes 2 is the definition of two steps forward one step back. While the main course is definitely an improvement from its predecessor, literally everything else is a letdown.

Created in 2001 by the legendary game designer Shigeru Miyamoto (which you may know for the Mario or Zelda series, to name a few), it had since suffered two very long hiatus, to the point where some fans even thought it was dead. The first one between Pikmin 2 (2004) and Pikmin 3 (2013), and the last since last year, when Pikmin 4 finally came out. Nintendo however had already tested the interest for a new game before, with the relatively successful release of Pikmin 3 Deluxe for the Nintendo Switch, back in 2020. Luckily for me, I discovered this series in that same year, during the pandemic lockdown, so I didn’t have to endure the long droughts.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But what all this has to do with Pikmin 4? As it turns out, this new entry not only embrace the entire series legacy, as it reinvent and expand it significantly.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-canonical-reboot&quot;&gt;A canonical reboot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Pikmin 1, we control a tiny astronaut named Captain Olimar, who crashes on an alien planet that closely resembles Earth, (although it’s never disclosed that it’s actually our Earth). He has 30 days to collect all the missing parts of his spaceship, in order to get back home before he runs out of vital supplies. Luckily a few small creatures that grow like plants befriends with him and help him carry those missing parts and fight other not so friendly creatures, as long as Olimar helps to grow more their population. Those creatures are the titular Pikmin, and they exist in several varieties with distinct properties, such as resistance to fire, or ability to swim. The challenge is basically to command the Pikmins to overcome the challenges imposed to us, by alternating between the varieties best suited for specific tasks.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In Pikmin 4, we also start with Captain Olimar and a similar premise, although, in this case the mission doesn’t end well, neither for him nor the rescue corps that received his distress signal. Although, there was one last rookie rescue officer available to help. It’s precisely that rookie, that can be customized to our image, that we control during the rest of the game. Our main goal is to rescue all this people lost on the planet.

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ A brief introduction to Pikmin 4's plot and main mechanics.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rescuing-the-rescuers&quot;&gt;Rescuing the rescuers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as we start our mission, we realise that there are much more castways needing rescue than anticipated, beside the rescue corps. Apparently many different people were already exploring this planet for very different reasons, but all of them ended in a similar way - either unconscious or infected by a condition that transformed them in some kind of pikmin themselves. In the later case, to rescue them, we need to defeat them in a “Dandori” battle, where the goal is to collect more treasures than the opponent in a confined space and a limited amount of time. But the rescue doesn’t end there. To cure their unique condition, we need to collect a nectar that’s only available during night. As so, beside the usual daily expeditions, where we start at the morning and leave by sunset, we have, for the first time in the series, night expeditions. During those, we only have access to a new type of glowing pikmins and our job is to protect the sources of the nectar from the enemies until sunrise, functioning like a tower defense game.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These two new type of challenges, Dandori battles and night expeditions, bring a fresh spin to the gameplay loop of the series, that before that had its focus solely on collecting treasures. By the way, treasures are still here and continue to be a crucial part of the game, as they serve as fuel for our spaceship in order to explore more areas. Nonetheless, the biggest gameplay innovation Pikmin 4 brings is in the form of Oachi, a dog from the rescue corps that we can use in many different ways. Oachi can carry all the pikmins and ourselves to cross lakes or protect from enemies, carry treasures, break obstacles, fight enemies, and even control pikmins, enableing some degree of multitasking.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-love-letter-to-the-fans&quot;&gt;A love letter to the fans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a lot of new mechanics were introduced, the developers were clever enough to understand what elements worked the best in the previous entries and bring them back. The most obvious example of that are the caves, which were a core part of Pikmin 2. While on that game the caves were procedurally generated, creating a lot of unbalanced (and many times infuriating) level designs, in Pikmin 4 all caves are carefully designed, delivering a much more refined experience.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Besides the mechanics, the characters and travel logs also reveal a lot of references to the previous games events, some more obvious than others. After rescuing Captain Olimar, which is the main part mission and what will trigger the ending credits, we can play a new mode where we relive the events from his shipwrecking to the distress signal sending. For new players, this would be just more content to play, which is always nice, but for those who played every previous game to this point, becomes clear that it’s essentially the campaign of the very first Pikmin game, reinvented to fit the current narrative and environments. To have such thing as just a clever bonus content, put in perspective the enormous scope and attention to detail put in Pikmin 4.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ton of treasures to collect and castways to rescue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New Dandori battles and night expeditions give a solid but fair challenge&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The best mechanics of the 3 previous games are present here&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The perfect game for both rookies and veterans of the series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soundtrack is a bit forgettable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UI menus are more generic, comparing with the previous entries
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;masterpiece&quot;&gt;Masterpiece&lt;span class=&quot;u-ft-sans&quot;&gt;✦✦✦✦✦&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pikmin 4 was successful in the arduous task of being accessible for new players, while rewarding the longtime fans with a compelling experience full of nods to the series previous entries.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="review" /><summary type="html">Since its inception, the Pikmin franchise has always been highly praised, and yet, very niche. Created in 2001 by the legendary game designer Shigeru Miyamoto (which you may know for the Mario or Zelda series, to name a few), it had since suffered two very long hiatus, to the point where some fans even thought it was dead. The first one between Pikmin 2 (2004) and Pikmin 3 (2013), and the last since last year, when Pikmin 4 finally came out. Nintendo however had already tested the interest for a new game before, with the relatively successful release of Pikmin 3 Deluxe for the Nintendo Switch, back in 2020. Luckily for me, I discovered this series in that same year, during the pandemic lockdown, so I didn’t have to endure the long droughts. But what all this has to do with Pikmin 4? As it turns out, this new entry not only embrace the entire series legacy, as it reinvent and expand it significantly.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Played this month – January 2024</title><link href="https://joaomarques.website/abxy/played-this-month-jan-24" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Played this month – January 2024" /><published>2024-02-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-02-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://joaomarques.website/abxy/played-this-month-jan-24</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://joaomarques.website/abxy/played-this-month-jan-24">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first “Played this month”. This will be, as the name suggests, a series where I give some brief personal opinion about the games I played during the month that just ended. In January I tried a few new games (new at least for me), but only two of them really got my full attention and dedication. Here’s what I played:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action RPG / PS4
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy was the first game I finished this year. It’s focused in Midgar, where the original game starts, giving to the city a gigantic facelift with detailed graphics, for the most part, and spectacular cutscenes, in classic Square Enix fashion, and introducing a new action focused combat system. Overall it was a great experience, but not without a few flaws, like some lackluster side quests, to give an example.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Pikmin 4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real-time strategy / Nintendo Switch
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Pikmin fan, this was a game I knew I would have a great time with, even before starting to play it. After almost 40 hours of gameplay and 100% completion, it managed to not only match my high expectations but even surpass them. I will keep it short for now, as I will do a full review of Pikmin 4 soon.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tactical RPG / Nintendo 3DS
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My quest to find a Fire Emblem game that I like more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkux5h0PeXo&quot;&gt;Three Houses&lt;/a&gt; is yet prove to be fruitless. Echoes: Shadows of Valentia was the closest I got from that, but even so, I didn’t have the drive to keep playing it until the end. My save file was abandoned for almost an year, much like my Nintendo 3DS. I decided to do a quick battle, just to try to get back in the game, but I forgot completely the story so far and many of the characters. I may need to watch a recap before playing more.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Very Very Valet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casual / Nintendo Switch
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago in a company retreat I had, I tried a few casual multiplayer games whose names I can’t even remember, but one of them stood from the crowd to me. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feyHL0GfcIo&quot;&gt;Very Very Valet&lt;/a&gt; combined the Overcooked-like co-op strategy with some crazy driving mechanics, in the same style as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5x547gzU_g&quot;&gt;Micro Machines&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA-430ZNqZg&quot;&gt;R.C. Pro-Am&lt;/a&gt;, to deliver an hilariously chaotic experience.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Shin Megami Tensei V&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RPG / Nintendo Switch
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After enjoying &lt;a href=&quot;https://joaomarques.website/abxy/persona-4-golden&quot;&gt;Persona 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://joaomarques.website/abxy/persona-5-royal&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; so much, I decided to try the series that started it all, just to realize how brutally difficult it is, to the point that on my third regular battle, I was presented with the Game Over screen. SMT V is what can be described as a true “hardcore” experience. It didn’t convinced me in the same way as its more successful spinoff, as so, I will put this game on hold for now. The only thing I truly enjoyed during my brief time with it, was its soundtrack. Seriously, it seems like Atlus simply can’t make games without some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohi99qWYngc&quot;&gt;bangers&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And that’s all for January. For next month, one thing I know for sure, it will be all about the new Persona 3 Reload. See you next time!

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In terms of video games, 2023 was the year of Persona for me. If you are following my retrospective series, you may have already come to that conclusion. But my obsession with the franchise started back in 2022 when I decided to finally give a chance to a game that so many people talked wonders about. The game in question? In case you didn’t read the title of this review, it’s Persona 5 Royal. To give you a bit of context, I never had much interest in JRPGs (Japanese role-playing games) before. My only experience worth noting with the genre was a couple of hours in Final Fantasy VII before I dropped it for whatever reason (I intend to replay it properly in the near future, though). But there was something about Persona 5 that always drew my attention. It was not the detailed anime-like aesthetic, nor the captivating gameplay. It was actually its sense of style, present in all clips and trailers I saw from it. The impulse to play Persona 5 once and for all came when ports of it were announced for Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and PC. The marketing surrounding them put the game again on my radar, and so, I snagged a cheap second-handed copy for the PS4, just to try it. To my surprise, I got immediately hooked.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tokyo-daylife&quot;&gt;Tokyo daylife&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persona 5, being a Persona game, follows for the most part the classic Persona formula. If you don’t know what any of this means, I vividly recommend you to read &lt;a href=&quot;https://joaomarques.website/abxy/persona-4-golden&quot;&gt;my review of Persona 4 Golden&lt;/a&gt;, where I explain briefly how this unique franchise works. While the previous games opted for smaller or lesser-known settings around Japan, this one went for the iconic capital city, Tokyo. During the many hours of gameplay, you can explore many well-known locations, such as Shibuya crossing and its surroundings. While I can’t say how faithful the in-game recreations of these places are, since I’ve never been to Japan, I can tell there is a feeling of authenticity in them. One place in particular that I want to highlight is actually the humble neighborhood of Yongen-Jaya, where the game’s protagonist lives during its events.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;into-the-metaverse&quot;&gt;Into the Metaverse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our protagonist, in classic Persona fashion, is a teenager who is forced to get away from his hometown and spend an entire year in a new city. This time around, the reason is probation imposed on him, due to a crime he was wrongly accused of. For some reason, a family friend who lives in Tokyo accepted to welcome him during that period, keeping him under a watchful eye. While still adapting to his new life by getting to know his classmates and teachers at his new school, he accidentally ends up in a parallel reality, known as the “Metaverse” (no, it’s not the one that you are thinking of). In this Metaverse, the protagonist finds distorted (and deeply disturbing) versions of people he met in the real world, including the one responsible for his crime accusation. Those versions consist of the personification of their twisted desires, and it’s our job, by incarnating this protagonist, to defeat them with our Persona abilities.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One of the many questionable people we meet during the game’s narrative is the school’s PE teacher and volleyball team coach, who abuses physically and sexually his trainees. In the Metaverse, he takes the form of a king, living in a castle guarded by tokenized versions of those same trainees. This castle is actually the first of many dungeons present in the game. As in the case I just mentioned, every dungeon is carefully designed around the person we must defeat, as are the real-world events surrounding it, making them a spectacular part of the full experience.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;c-post__video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hb1gfNgOAwo&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ The first explorable dungeon we encounter in this game.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stylish-rebellion&quot;&gt;Stylish rebellion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the spectacularity of these dungeons, and the entire game, is severely amplified by its incredible art direction. Character and scenario designs aside, the real star of the show, in my opinion, is the user interface. Persona 5, like any RPG, relies a lot on many different menus for all kinds of actions, and every single one of them here has unique layouts and animations presented in a punk aesthetic, fitting the game’s theme of breaking society’s moral corruption. If that wasn’t enough, such visual galore is scored by one of the best soundtracks I ever had the pleasure to hear in a video game, composed in a jazzy style (in lack of a more technical term). Any words I write here won’t do justice to it, so the best I can do is to recommend you to listen to it for yourself.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Persona 5 is undeniably fantastic, it’s worth noticing its biggest issue: its longevity. Depending on the person, this can be either a problem or a benefit. It took me 132 hours to finish the game, and I still missed several things during my playtime. The case is ‘aggravated’ in its Royal version (the one I played), which expands significantly the length of the story. It’s a great bang for your buck for sure, but if you are someone like me, who likes to play several different games in many different styles, being stuck in a single one for months can be just a bit tiresome. Even so, on the day after I finally ended my lengthy journey with Persona 5 Royal, I was already missing it.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unique and impactful art style&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amazing, explorable dungeons&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Story full of deep and morally dark themes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One of the best original soundtracks ever created for a game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It requires a significant time investment just to finish it
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even considering it’s not a game for everyone, Persona 5 Royal is without a doubt one of the very best ever made. Its incredible sense of style and attention to detail brought many new fans to this fantastic series, with me being one of them.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Few games raise unreasonably high expectations upon release as a new Zelda. It isn’t by chance. More than 35 years of nothing but incredible games guaranteed such a reputation for the iconic Nintendo series. Most of those games’ style and lore work in isolation, being only connected by a loose &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-25c8Rsobw&quot;&gt;timeline&lt;/a&gt;, but after the staggering success of Breath of the Wild, it wasn’t a huge surprise when the company announced back in 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Zr9eAtwcYlo?si=KLAEfvjHVjsW6qwZ&amp;amp;t=2466&quot;&gt;during one of its presentations&lt;/a&gt;, a direct sequel to it. Well, it was a surprise nonetheless, but it made total sense. The game had a long development cycle, and its fresh new gameplay formula still had a lot to give. The hope, for us fans, was that a direct sequel would take less time to develop, since they already had many core elements in place. Oh boy, how we were wrong. Four long years separated that reveal trailer from the actual release date. Was the wait worth it? In my view, it was, but not without a few minor hiccups.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;that-déjà-vu-feeling&quot;&gt;That déjà vu feeling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action of Tears of the Kingdom occurs at the exact same version of Hyrule (the kingdom present in some form in most Zelda games) as Breath of the Wild, which grants an unavoidable sense of familiarity to those who played that game. One of the most enjoyable aspects of the experience back then was to discover gradually all the interconnected regions of the kingdom, just to be surprised by their completely distinct biomes. Obviously, most of that is gone now that we are presented with the same challenge again. Although, many things changed in the land of Hyrule between both games. The lives of the Hylians we meet before had moved on, and many of them have new stories and challenges to unfold. Some even relocated to entirely new places. Not only that, but many regions now face particular climatic issues, changing dramatically the feeling and exploration of them. But the most evident change is without a doubt the mysterious appearance of countless islands in the sky. This is thrown to our face right from the beginning, since it’s on one of those islands where the game properly begins.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-sky-is-the-limit-literally&quot;&gt;The sky is the limit, literally&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start our journey on a floating island that conveniently introduces us to all the new (and old) game mechanics. Think of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/Great_Plateau&quot;&gt;Great Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, but in the sky. We have our shrines, and they work in the exact same way as before. We are gradually introduced to our new array of abilities and forced in some way to put them in use. After that, we are left to our own devices and invited to dive off the island into a pond on the distant surface. When arriving there, we are presented with several weird holes in the ground, some of them bigger than the pond where we just dived. By jumping into any of them, a whole new dark and unwelcoming underworld is revealed to us. That’s right! This Hyrule has two extra layers beside the already gigantic surface level, significantly increasing its scope. The game even plays with this verticality with some puzzles interconnecting all three layers, by starting in the highest point in the sky and ending in the darkest depths. And if you’re wondering, yes, it’s possible to skydive from an island straight down to the underworld, seamlessly.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The renovated world is only part of the reason why this game is impressive, though. What takes Tears of the Kingdom to the next level is what we can do in it. As I mentioned before, we are given four main abilities that change dramatically the way we interact with the environment: &lt;strong&gt;Ascend&lt;/strong&gt; lets us merge into most surfaces above us and rise on top of them. It’s very useful to escape caves or wells, but it can be used in more cases than that. &lt;strong&gt;Recall&lt;/strong&gt; allows us to revert the flow of time of any object. &lt;strong&gt;Fuse&lt;/strong&gt;, as the name suggests, lets us fuse a weapon or shield to another object, allowing us to improve their properties or even give them powerful, and sometimes funny, new perks. The star of the show, though, is &lt;strong&gt;Ultrahand&lt;/strong&gt;. With it, it’s possible to remotely manipulate and glue together as many objects as we want. By itself, it’s impressive, but when combined with the many ancient technological artifacts left around the world, such as rockets, wheels, fans, laser beams, and many more, they invite the player to engineer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9_O94KqRAo&quot;&gt;the most useful, or absurd, creations&lt;/a&gt;. Such a powerful tool comes with the price of being a bit cumbersome to use because everything is done in real time. There is no separated creation mode. But after a few dozen hours, it’s possible to get the gist of it.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;demon-king-secret-stone&quot;&gt;Demon King? Secret stone?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time now to address what is, in my opinion, the elephant in the room in Tears of the Kingdom: its story. In short, it doesn’t work really well. Two things that were promised during the months before its release were that the game would feature the return of dungeons in a more “classic” style and would tell a more complex narrative. While the first promise was somewhat delivered (even considering a very underwhelming water dungeon), the second failed because of the game’s structure. You see, Breath of the Wild had a very simple plot, but it was brilliantly executed. You learned the full story by collecting small pieces of information without any specific order, but none of those pieces required much context to be understood.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With Tears of the Kingdom, they decided to use the exact same plot structure but with a more interconnected plotline. During most of the game, I was completely clueless about what was actually happening story-wise and how I would complete my main objective, which was to find Zelda. Oh yeah, I totally forgot to explain that part. So, long story short: Link and Zelda were exploring some underground ruins and suddenly they find a recurring villain of the series, Ganondorf, also known as the “Demon King,” in a decayed state, held by a mysterious glowing arm. Ganondorf awakes, throws Zelda into a dark pit, and almost kills Link. Then, Link awakens on the sky island I mentioned before, with that very same glowing arm in place of his own injured one. Confused? Me too. In the lack of a better expression, this plot is completely bonkers. The worst part, in my opinion, is what happens next. Link is told that some strange phenomena are happening at the same four main locations that were home to the four divine beasts from Breath of the Wild and that, for some reason, could be related to Zelda’s disappearance. After we clear each one of the region’s subplots, we are presented with a very similar cutscene each time, only differing in the people involved. Each and every time, the character in question says the exact same thing. By the fourth time I heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU5q0dFeHVI&quot;&gt;“Demon King? Secret Stone?”&lt;/a&gt; my faith in this plot was practically gone.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ The events that trigger this rather confusing plot.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It’s so obvious that this story was built around the gameplay that it hurts. But you know what? I’m glad it was like that and not the other way around. Obviously, a balanced approach was the ideal scenario, but I understand it was an almost impossible task to build a concise story without sacrificing some of the freedom. Fun was clearly the priority with Tears of the Kingdom, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ultrahand ability usage is a bit convoluted&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The narrative is weakened by its non-linear presentation

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;masterpiece&quot;&gt;Masterpiece&lt;span class=&quot;u-ft-sans&quot;&gt;✦✦✦✦✦&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a very difficult game to objectively analise. It does have clear issues, but only because it tries to reach highs that others don’t even dream to. Even so, I say without any reservations that it is one of the most engineous open-world sandbox experience ever made.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Born as a spin-off of Shin Megami Tensei, the Persona series was able to considerably outgrow its origins in popularity. Most of the credit is due to its fifth mainline entry, which was able to dip its toe into mainstream culture. But even before Persona 5 took the JRPG world by storm, Persona 4 already had a considerable fanbase. Initially released in 2008 for the by-then outdated PlayStation 2, the game gained a second life when its “deluxe” version, Persona 4 Golden, was released in 2012 for the ill-fated PlayStation Vita. Due to the small library of the portable system, the game quickly gained the status of one of the very best in there (it is, in fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/ps-vita/all/all-time/metascore/?releaseYearMin=1958&amp;amp;releaseYearMax=2023&amp;amp;platform=ps-vita&amp;amp;page=1&quot;&gt;the best-rated PS Vita game on Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;). P4G stayed for many years stuck on the poor Vita, with multiplatform ports coming out much, much later. How much precisely? 8 years later for PC and 11 (eleven!) for Xbox, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch. But what is so special about this series, and this game in particular, that makes it so worthwhile to play after all this time?
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-persona-formula&quot;&gt;The Persona formula&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their differences, every mainline Persona game follows a very specific formula that sets them apart from anything else: We play as a Japanese teenager who just moved to a new town and we follow the events of an entire year, day by day. We will attend school during weekdays, explore the town during our free time, and make some friends along the way by spending time with whomever we decide to. It also happens that we have a particular psychic ability that makes us able to reach a parallel world that “exists between mind and matter, dream and reality,” as a character that serves as our spiritual guide explains to us. In that world, we fight &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;shadows&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that are essentially monstrous materializations of personalities. How do we fight them? With weapons and our own shadows, which, when controlled by us, are named as, you guessed it, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;personas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s a concept quite similar to Pokémon. Every persona has elemental strengths and weaknesses, and we need to constantly switch between the ones we possess to effectively defeat the shadows we encounter. With some strategy and luck, we can recruit some of those shadows to our compendium of personas.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;c-post__video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/b0T7MfjGPgU&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ This is one of the first dungeons in the game, full of shadows to defeat and collect.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While completely distinct, these two facets of the gameplay structure complement each other. The actions we take during the life simulation sections will give us advantages during combat, such as stat boosts in a particular type of persona, or even the possibility to have friends to fight alongside us in the shadow world. On the other hand, our fights in the combat sections will unlock key events in the game’s extensive story.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deadly-mystery-in-the-small-town&quot;&gt;Deadly mystery in the small town&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrative of Persona 4 is set in a small Japanese town named Inaba. Our protagonist just arrived to live with his uncle for an entire year due to his parents going on a very long business trip. During that same time, the otherwise uneventful town becomes the center of a recent serial murder case. It happens that the aforementioned uncle works as a detective for the local police, which puts us right at the center of the action. While he doesn’t necessarily disclose details of the investigation, the people around him do, such as his clumsy assistant or his young daughter. Coincidentally, a rumor about an unidentified broadcast that appears on TVs during rainy nights, appropriately named the “Midnight Channel”, is being spread around the high school the protagonist attends. With nothing better to do, he decides to see if said rumor is true. Not only does he find it is, but that the channel turns the TV into a portal to a shadow world. Following that finding, he and the few people in the school who also experienced the same are able to find connections between it and the serial murder victims, forming together an investigation team, resembling some sort of a japanese version of &lt;em&gt;Scooby Doo’s Mystery Inc.&lt;/em&gt; The action unfolds with the investigation team identifying future victims inside the shadow world, one by one, and saving them before they die. All of this while trying to uncover all the truth behind everything happening.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What makes this game truly special to me is how it’s able to seamlessly combine such high-stakes narrative with life in a small town. At any point in the story, all the people we encounter on Inaba’s streets will have some opinion about the current events and the consequences of our investigation team’s actions. After dozens of hours and countless visits to the same few places, we’ll know the entire town and its people, to the point where when we need to investigate something in particular, we already know where to go and who to talk to. This feeling is highly relatable to me, as I grew up in a small town as well. Despite all the cultural differences between my home country and Japan, the feeling is the same. I can’t deny that this made me appreciate this game even more.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ During the free time, we can explore the town of Inaba and deepen relationships.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;seeing-and-hearing-the-truth&quot;&gt;Seeing and hearing the truth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any videogame, the audiovisual presentation is undeniably a key factor to determine our enjoyment of it, and P4G is a game full of contrasts in that aspect. To start, we have a very solid art direction, dominated by yellow and warm tones, from the game interface to the scenarios. Yellow isn’t my favourite color, far from it, but it works really well in this context, providing a cozy feeling to the experience. Unfortunately, all this was paired with a very basic graphics engine (even for PlayStation 2 standards) that doesn’t do justice to the amazing character portrait draws. The characters 3D models have very low polygonal counts and stiff animations, while the dungeons during the combat sections are incredibly repetitive, using the same assets in every room and hallway. This issue is even more noticable while playing at 1080p resolution or above, which is the case of the most recent ports. The positive side of this is that even on Nintendo Switch it loads really fast and performs at some stable 60fps.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While the visuals are a mixed bag, the soundtrack is solid, which is a good thing because this isn’t a short game. The predominant style is definitely J-pop, which initially didn’t match my taste, but after a few dozen hours, I already had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gYo1tpi9A&quot;&gt;“Heartbreak, heartbreak, it keeps on pounding”&lt;/a&gt; engraved in my mind.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Exploring dungeons is a bit of a chore

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persona 4 Golden is an all-time JRPG classic that balances wonderfully a high-stakes narrative with the slowly paced life in a rural town.

I wasn’t expecting to have already five posts in such short time period, but here we are. Anyway, thank you for reading my stuff, regardless of if you read everything so far or if you just found this humble blog.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s now focus on today’s topic: What have I been playing during this year. Not a lot to be honest, comparing at least with previous ones, if we consider only game variety. It was a year where I invested a lot of time into western and japanese RPGs, genres notorious for their lengthy narratives and all kinds of griding activities. No wonder I didn’t have time for much else. In a year jam-packed with fantastic releases (some may argue it was one of the best years ever in that regard), very few ended in on my 2023 playthrough. Only three new titles, with two of them being remasters or remakes, had my attention during this last 12 months. However, there are still a few games released this year I want to play, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqpbMLVa9EI&quot;&gt;Pikmin 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtDNA_kiZ4&quot;&gt;Fire Emblem Engage&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully, next year I will be talking about them right here.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Without further ado, here are all the games I finished this year, listed by finishing date:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;March 7th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Persona 5 Royal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RPG / PS4 / 132 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persona 5 Royal consumed a gigantic amount of my time during the first months of the year. Even though is a japanese RPG, the game (and by extension the whole series) stays away from the typical medieval or dystopic fantasies, with the action occouring on a current day Tokyo setting, which make the characters more relatable and the lenghty story more gripping. This was by far the biggest single player game I ever played. Luckily it was also an absolute masterpiece, recieving the distinction of &lt;strong&gt;my favourite of the entire year&lt;/strong&gt;. As so, I will give it a full review soon.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;March 25th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Metroid Prime Remastered&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action-adventure / Nintendo Switch / 25 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a surprise this remaster was. The Gamecube original was already a masterpiece, reinventing the Metroidvania subgenre in a 3D first-person perspective, and yet Retro Studios (the developer behind it) managed to improve the few flaws the game had, turning it into something truly perfect. It’s no exaggeration to say that Metroid Prime Remastered is one of the best looking games in the Nintendo Switch library.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;March 26th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Grid Legends&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racing / PS4 / 9 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like racing games that deliver some plot and Grid Legends promised exactly that, with a campaign following a structure heavily influenced by the Netflix series &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEY3Q43aE_c&quot;&gt;Formula 1 Drive to Survive&lt;/a&gt;. We play as a rookie for the underdog team, obviously, during two seasons of the fictional Grid Series, and between races we are presented with some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlNWdYkR-TE&quot;&gt;cutscenes&lt;/a&gt; in a behind the scenes documental style, where we are introduced to the members of our team and some rivals. Sadly the campaign end up feeling a bit short and the rest of the content isn’t nearly as interesting. At least the few hours I spent with it were quite enjoyable.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;April 20th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Marvel’s Spider-Man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action-adventure / PS4 / 25 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never had much interest in superheroes, but if I had to mention my favourite I would say Spider-Man. That alone raised my consideration for this Marvel’s Spider-Man, but even if we ignore the iconic web slinger, this is a great action game. Although, after a couple hours, the game starts to be a tad repetitive. I must admit that I was expecting a bit more variety from it, considering the high acclaims it had on its release. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;May 31th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Advance Wars 1+2: Reboot Camp&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn-based strategy / Nintendo Switch / 45 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advance Wars 2 was one of THE games of my childhood, as so, when I saw the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fftL_XeK2qU&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of its remake (alongside its predecessor), I knew it was a day one purchase for me. All things considered it was an extremely faithful remake, gameplay wise. The biggest difference laid on the new art style. The toy box aesthetic wasn’t my favourite, must admit, but it had grown on me. Nonetheless, behind the cartoonish aspect, this are two of the best-turn based strategy games ever made, rolled into a sleek package.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;July 12th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action-adventure / Nintendo Switch / 90 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tears of the Kingdom was the game I was most eager to play this year and it’s safe to say that it didn’t disappointed, even considering the unreasonably high expectations upon its release. It was bigger and better than its predecessor in almost every aspect. Although this time around the surprise factor wasn’t as huge as with Breath of the Wild. Nonetheless, it was still &lt;strong&gt;my second favourite game of the year&lt;/strong&gt;. This one will also receive a full review here later on.

&lt;p&gt;Action-adventure / Nintendo 3DS / 28 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right, I played two Zelda titles in a row. Well, actually, I had an abandoned save file on my 3DS and finally got the motivation to finish it once and for all. I now understand why Ocarina of Time is one of the most acclaimed games of all time, being a timeless epic adventure.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;September 8th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action RPG / PS4 / 66 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may not know, but I already wrote a review for this game. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://joaomarques.website/abxy/cyberpunk-2077&quot;&gt;check it here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Metroid Prime 2: Echoes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action-adventure / Nintendo Gamecube / 20 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metroid Prime 2 is centered around two parallel worlds, one of light and other of darkness. Not a novel concept, but one always with huge potential. In theory it seemed like a fantastic idea, but unfortunately made the game unecessarly repetitive. It certainly didn’t help that the entire dark world was engulfed in a purple mist, making it very unpleasant to look after a few hours. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a very good game, but I didn’t liked it nearly as much as its predecessor.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;October 28th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racing / PS4 / 36 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GT7 is one of those titles where the experience changes dramatically depending on the input used. It plays fine with a controller, but with a proper racing wheel and pedals this game takes on a whole new life. It’s by far the best racing experience I’ve had at home. The only problem with it is the extremely aggressive monetization. Some cars are prohibitively expensive just to encourage players to buy them with real life money, or grind to death for the necessary credits. Otherwise, how would I put my hands into the legendary &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/tI-fR5USR2M?si=24d4ctrmafvdZ4Rn&amp;amp;t=20&quot;&gt;McLaren MP4/4&lt;/a&gt;?
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Persona 4 Golden&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RPG / Nintendo Switch / 93 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After enjoying Persona 5 so much, my interest for the whole series sparked almost immediately. So, logically I decided to explore its previous main entry. While similar in its gameplay structure, Persona 4 setting and story are much more intimate, with the main narrative focusing on a serial murder case in a small japanese town. With no surprise it turned out to be &lt;strong&gt;my third favourite game of the year&lt;/strong&gt;, completing my podium of favourite games of 2023. Just like Persona 5 Royal and Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, Persona 4 Golden will also receive a full review on this very blog.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ While not as stylish as its successor, Persona 4 strength lies in its charming setting and characters.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Fallout 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action-RPG / Xbox 360 / 42 hours
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first Fallout game I ever played and the first Bethesda Game Studios game I ever finished. I already spent some time with Skyrim in the past, but got myself distracted with the endless side quests. This time I forced myself to not steer too much away from the main story. Soon I realised that the main story of Fallout 3 wasn’t all that great, apart from an amazing mission involving a virtual reality. What makes this game truly special is all the smaller side stories happening all around the wasteland and the freedom we have to determine their resolution.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;u-mb-1&quot;&gt;December 24th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Panzer Dragoon: Remake&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rail shooter / Nintendo Switch / 2h
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To close the year I played the first game in one of Sega’s most underrated series, Panzer Dragoon, in its remade version. While the visuals were completely overhauled to make justice to the amazing art direction of the original, the gameplay remained intact, apart from an optional new control scheme. Also worth noting is the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3nkw7RTcsM&quot;&gt;reimagined soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;, making it stylistically closer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/CJBYS-3SqHE?si=UfQfYwRfDvZwEmWt&amp;amp;t=1091&quot;&gt;sound of its sequel&lt;/a&gt; (that for me is the absolute best in the series).
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And that’s all! As I mentioned before, you can expect reviews of the three games I enjoyed the most in 2023, &lt;strong&gt;Persona 5 Royal&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kindgom&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Persona 4 Golden&lt;/strong&gt;, here at ABXY. See you next year!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="update" /><summary type="html">We now reach the end of 2023 and with that the end of the first month of activity of ABXY. I wasn’t expecting to have already five posts in such short time period, but here we are. Anyway, thank you for reading my stuff, regardless of if you read everything so far or if you just found this humble blog. Let’s now focus on today’s topic: What have I been playing during this year. Not a lot to be honest, comparing at least with previous ones, if we consider only game variety. It was a year where I invested a lot of time into western and japanese RPGs, genres notorious for their lengthy narratives and all kinds of griding activities. No wonder I didn’t have time for much else. In a year jam-packed with fantastic releases (some may argue it was one of the best years ever in that regard), very few ended in on my 2023 playthrough. Only three new titles, with two of them being remasters or remakes, had my attention during this last 12 months. However, there are still a few games released this year I want to play, like Pikmin 4 and Fire Emblem Engage. Hopefully, next year I will be talking about them right here. Without further ado, here are all the games I finished this year, listed by finishing date:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Winners and Losers of The Game Awards 2023</title><link href="https://joaomarques.website/abxy/the-game-awards-2023" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Winners and Losers of The Game Awards 2023" /><published>2023-12-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://joaomarques.website/abxy/the-game-awards-2023</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://joaomarques.website/abxy/the-game-awards-2023">&lt;p&gt;Beside the usual festive season, the end of the year is now also marked by a more recent tradition, The Game Awards. This event was initially created in 2014 by the gaming journalist Geoff Keighley to award the best games released each year, but has steadily grown to be more of a showcase for announcements of the upcoming ones, mixed with a considerable amount of related advertisement, absorbing some of the mediatic space left by the now (probably) defunct E3. It’s safe to say that TGA is by now one of the most important events in this media, with a viewership of 103 millions in 2022, according to the organisation. As so, everyone is interested in having a small piece the three and half hours of the ceremony’s runtime, from the small indie studios to the big names. There’s a bit of everything in here.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But let’s focus on what happened during this year’s edition. Who came out on top and who or what were the biggest disappointments? Let’s find out by nominating the winners and losers of the The Game Awards 2023.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;winners&quot;&gt;Winners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;baldurs-gate-3&quot;&gt;Baldur’s Gate 3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no way to deny it, Baldur’s Gate 3 was the indisputable winner of this year, claiming 6 awards in 9 nominations, including Game Of The Year. This feat was even more impressive if we consider the quality of the other nominees in every category it claimed, being this one of the most competitive years ever. I personally didn’t played it as I’m not that invested in Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons (in which this game is based of), but I believe all the acclaim was deserved. After all, it was arguably the best-received game this year, being truly consensual among critics and fans.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alan-wake-2&quot;&gt;Alan Wake 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other game that collected a nice amount of little statues, with 3 awards in 8 nominations. Curiously, Alan Wake 2 was announced to the public precisely at The Game Awards, two years prior. Surely a must play for fans of survival horror.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sega&quot;&gt;Sega&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who would have thought that Sega would have the best announcement of this TGA? I didn’t, even thought they teased it a few days before. Sega has a precedent of overpromising and underdelivering, so I was cautious. Surprisingly this time the hype was justified. They announced FIVE new titles at once, from their repertoire of dormant franchises: Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Streets of Rage, Shinobi and Golden Axe. As a long time Sega fan, it’s impossible to not be excited with this. The only problem I saw was the fact they mentioned that this games were “now in development”, which means that we probably won’t see them anytime soon. One or two may come out later in 2024, but my hopes are low. To be fair, I don’t mind to wait. Kudos also to Atlus (which Sega owns), for showing new trailers for the two games I’m most eager to play next year: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4py4V5xwXWE&quot;&gt;Persona 3 Reload&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4bGNzXnKak&quot;&gt;Metaphor: ReFantazio&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ The trailer was a bit cheesy, but the games revealed look promising.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hideo-kojima&quot;&gt;Hideo Kojima&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s well known that the mastermind behind Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding has a good relationship with Geoff Keighley, which grants him a free pass to use TGA as its own marketing platform. At this point it would be a surprise to not see him on stage talking during several minutes about an upcoming project without showing anything substantial about it. This year we were presented with a game called “OD”, with the only thing shown being a tech demo of a few face animations. It was weird, in classic Kojima fashion. I don’t know if it was a win for the public in general, but for him it was for sure. See you next year Kojima-san.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;honorable-mention&quot;&gt;Honorable Mention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nintendo&quot;&gt;Nintendo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With little to no presence during the event, Nintendo managed to sneakily snag 3 awards: Best Action / Adventure Game (The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom), Best Family Game (Super Mario Bros. Wonder) and Best Sim / Strategy Game (Pikmin 4), in a total of 15 nominations. A fair reward considering the great year they had in terms of releases. Regarding the future, Nintendo didn’t unveil the curtain, although their 2024 looks pretty slim so far. Probably not the right time for announcements, as they might have bigger fish to fry with their imminent upcoming system.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;losers&quot;&gt;Losers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;marvels-spider-man-2&quot;&gt;Marvel’s Spider Man 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony’s sole horse for the silverware race lost in a spectacular way, taking home a staggering amount of zero awards, in 7 nominations. It was unfortunate, as the game actually looks good and should be fun to play, taking in consideration my knowledge of its predecessor. However, it was outclassed in every category it was nominated for. As I said before, this was a very competitive year and Spider Man 2 ended up being the colateral damage.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;starfield&quot;&gt;Starfield&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was already known that Starfield wouldn’t be in the discussion for a huge amount of awards, as it wasn’t even nominated for Game of the Year, but considering it was one of the most anticipated games of 2023, it’s disappointing to see Xbox and Bethesda’s newest crown jewel relegated to second plan, recieveing a single nomination for Best Role Playing Game. Even there it had the misfortue of encounter and lose to the inevitable Baldur’s Gate 3. Can’t say it was unfair, since the game’s reception was mixed overall, but Todd Howard surely must be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyL5kKW5xAo&quot;&gt;a bit disapointed&lt;/a&gt; with this outcome. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;every-award-winner-on-stage&quot;&gt;Every award winner on stage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year during the winning speech for Best Performance, Christopher Judge, who portrayed Kratos in God of War Ragnarök, caught everyone by surprise by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij0VUU6L1io&amp;amp;t=255s&quot;&gt;speaking uninterruptedly for eight minutes&lt;/a&gt;. It was clear that even the production wasn’t aware of what was happening back then, because this year they overcompensated for that little detour. This time around each award winner had no more than a single minute to deliver their speech before having a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/javierabegazo/status/1732975428237934964&quot;&gt;“Please wrap it up”&lt;/a&gt; message on the teleprompter. The Game Awards always had problems in balancing the show between the awards itself and the promotional side, with the balance tending more and more in favour of the later as the years go by. I would be lying if I said that I don’t care about those announcements, but to put in perspective, any of the several ads for Lego Fortnite or Honkai: Star Rail that ran during the event lasted longer than any winner speech.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;c-post__video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vn_iJ7PBMJQ&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ Poor Aonuma-san, barely had time to read his speech, not to mention his translator.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
From the few interesting announcements, to the winners trimmed speeches, passing by the countless unnecessary ads (I know Lego Fortnite is a thing FFS, I saw the first ad), The Game Awards 2023 was a complete mixed bag. I hope Geoff takes his lessons from this year and turn this event into something truly great, because the potential is already there. Or probably give 20 minutes on stage to each winner to compensate for the overcompensation.
