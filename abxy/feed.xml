I grew up with the classic trilogy games (&amp;amp; Knuckles), I had a great time with some of the less loved ones, such as Sonic 3D Blast, and even pre-ordered Sonic Frontiers! Do you know how dumb it is to pre-order a Sonic game, knowing that there is a great chance for it to be mediocre and have a massive price cut one month later? I’m that type of fan. However, I’d never played Sonic Adventure until the end before. For some reason I never got very far in my previous attempts, losing interest after the first couple of stages. This time around, I decided to give it a real chance and find why many other fans have it in such high regard. After completing all the six different campaigns present in the game I was able to understand why, but only thanks to hefty doses of context and resilience.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-all-about-chaos&quot;&gt;It’s all about Chaos&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sonic Adventure was possibly the biggest pivot in the series history and consequently one of its most important games. When it came out in late 1998 for the Sega Dreamcast, a system that was a generational leap comparing with the Playstation and Nintendo 64, it was a graphical showpiece with large 3D environments, realistic textures and detailed character models. The characters themselves also received an extensive re-design and voice acting, allowing Sonic Team (the development team behind this game) to give them proper personalities and create more ambitious narratives. Gone was the &lt;em&gt;Classic Sonic&lt;/em&gt;, this was the beginning of the &lt;em&gt;Modern Sonic&lt;/em&gt; era.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of narratives, the one presented here is definitely the backbone of this game. As soon as we boot it up, we are presented with six different playable characters with distinct campaigns, although only Sonic is available at the start. As we progress in Sonic’s campaign, which is the &lt;em&gt;main course&lt;/em&gt; so to speak, we progressively unlock the other ones as their paths cross with the main character during the game events. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sonic’s story follows the same line of previous games, but with a new threat. Eggman wants to steal the Chaos Emeralds and use their power to conquer the world. To achieve it he uses a strange liquid creature named Chaos, that has the power to absorb the aforementioned emeralds and become even stronger. By facing Chaos multiple times during Sonic’s campaign we get the feeling that there’s something to uncover about it, but his story ends before reaching any conclusion. It turns out that defeating Eggman it’s just the tip of the iceberg. The real meat of it (yes, I’m using another food analogy in this article for no reason) is hidden in the other five campaigns. Pretty much like season 4 of Arrested Development (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367279/episodes/?season=4&quot;&gt;the original one&lt;/a&gt;, not the awful remixed version), each character provides an unique POV on a narrative where all of them participate together. Uncovering the truth behind Chaos is a game on itself, as the pace and deliver of this story is quite unconventional. Even so, in some part is less frustrating than playing the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; game.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;

    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zTonLUzwkX8&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ Sonic Adventure's intro cutscene presents us Chaos in its most intimidating form.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;big-problems&quot;&gt;Big problems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before Sonic’s campaign is the main focus here, and it shows. It’s the longest one in the game, composed of ten stages with the typical goal of going from A to B as fast as possible and a few boss battles in between. For the most part the stages are very well designed for Sonic’s precise and satisfying momentum-based controls, but it’s not too difficult to find issues. Quite often during my playthrough Sonic got stuck in some environmental detail, being it a wall, a rock or even the floor, causing him to glitch for a few seconds. This issue, usually called “clipping”, is a common thing in video games, but ideally it’s something very ocasional. Here it happens all the time. Maybe it’s a skill issue, but it’s a bad sign when the game breaks so easily when we go off rails. Speaking of that, I also have to mention the dynamic camera system of this game. Some specific points of each stage trigger a camera position and angle change, in theory to help the player see where they need to go next. But there is one problem. While the stages aren’t 100% linear, the camera only follows a single route. Exploring alternative paths while fighting the camera is beyond frustrating, even more so with a blazing fast character like Sonic.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;c-post__video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FR86QgC3eiE&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ This level is the epitome of Sonic Adventure: Great music, interesting concept and level layout, clipping issues left and right, absolutely terrible camera.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Sonic portion of Sonic Adventure has its problems, but its highlights almost overshadow them. I could end up here my review with this positive note, but unfortunately there’s much more to it. The &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; five campaigns to be more specific. To avoid bore you to death, I’ll keep it short and sweet and summarize each one of them in a few sentences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tails:&lt;/strong&gt; He tries to overcome his dependency on his best buddy Sonic by racing him on a few stages, but Tails flying ability is so OP that not even the &lt;em&gt;speed of sound&lt;/em&gt; is enough to overcome it.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knuckles:&lt;/strong&gt; His campaign consists in boring treasure hunts on stages that clearly weren’t designed for that purpose.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amy:&lt;/strong&gt; Another character who wants emancipation from Sonic (good for her), but at least her story is a bit more interesting. Oh, and she has a hammer to destroy some Eggman’s robots.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E-102 Gamma:&lt;/strong&gt; One of Eggman’s robots. It has the best story in the game to be honest, it’s just a shame it’s so short. Its gameplay isn’t bad either, be it all about shooting targets with a lock-on mechanism.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big the Cat:&lt;/strong&gt; Hope you like bad fishing mini-games, because that’s all we do here. I was this close (imagine me pinching my fingers) to give up at this point. To add insult to the injury, his story contributes in absolutely nothing to the overarching narrative. Seriously, who thought this was a good idea?
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;c-post__video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9MUxqwK6LjU&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ Big the Cat's campaign is undoubtedly the worst part of Sonic Adventure.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One thing in common with all campaigns is a freely explorable overworld. A cool idea in theory, but very poorly executed. To advance from stage to stage we first need to figure out where should we go or what should we do. It turns out that more often than not it isn’t exactly clear. We have a few hints spread around the overworld, but sometimes not even those are enough. I had to consult a walkthrough in several ocasions as I wasn’t thrilled to figure it out on my own.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The most positive aspect of Sonic Adventure is that Sonic Team undestood what worked and what didn’t, resulting in a much improved sequel, without overworlds or fishing mini games, in Sonic Adventure 2. But that’s a story for another day.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Layered and complex narrative across all the campaigns&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sonic’s precise controls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Too many clipping issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The objectives to progress in the game aren’t always clear&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The most obnoxious dynamic camera I ever saw in a videogame&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Big the Cat campaign
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;okay&quot;&gt;Okay&lt;span class=&quot;u-ft-sans&quot;&gt;✦✦✧✧✧&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sonic Adventure had the merit of pushing Sega’s mascot into a new dimension and defining much of what the series is to this day. However, as a videogame on its own, it has too many rough edges to be an entirely enjoyable experience.

As this is the game I was anticipating the most this year, I didn’t want to rush it and guarantee that I had my sweet time with it. The result of that was a sense of closure after 90 hours of gameplay spread around 4 months. But what is so special about Persona 3 Reload to make me go to such lengths? You see, &lt;a href=&quot;https://joaomarques.website/abxy/persona-4-golden&quot;&gt;Persona 4 Golden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://joaomarques.website/abxy/persona-5-royal&quot;&gt;Persona 5 Royal&lt;/a&gt; were two of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://joaomarques.website/abxy/my-2023-in-gaming&quot;&gt;top 3 games from last year&lt;/a&gt;. Their unique formula of dungeon crawling mixed with social simulation elements had its inception precisely with 2006’s Persona 3. While its story and concept remained very interesting, every other element of it was naturally outclassed by its successors. That’s why when a remake of it was announced last year, it felt like a match made in heaven for us Persona fans: one of the most interesting narratives in the series combined with all the best gameplay features from P4 and P5 (mostly P5).
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Be aware that since I didn’t play the original game (or any of its re-editions), this will be as much as a review for this particular remake as for Persona 3 itself. All the knowledge I have of the original versions came from research.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-darkest-hour&quot;&gt;The darkest hour&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of Persona 3 starts with the game’s protagonist arriving at a school dormitory in Tatsumi Port Island, the place where he will live for the next year along some other students. Initially, we don’t know much about this school or the island itself, but soon we realise that something fishy is going on, because right on the first night, as the clock hits the midnight, we enter in a somber reality where the sky becomes green and everyone except a few individuals transform into coffins (yes, you read it right). This reality is known as the &lt;strong&gt;Dark Hour&lt;/strong&gt; and our protagonist, as all the dormitory residents, are some of the lucky ones that are fully awaken during it. To make things worse, during the Dark Hour, the school is transformed into a gigantic tower by the name of Tartarus.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As the story quickly reveals, those students didn’t end up in the same dormitory by accident. They were gathered purposely to bond as a team and defeat the evil shadows who roams around the 264 floors of Tartarus, as to uncover its origin and purpose. Being awake during the Dark Hour comes with the perk of being able to summon a Persona, a creature that is the materialization of the inner self and it possesses great powers. As such, these students are better equipped for the job than anyone.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ Meet the S.E.E.S., the group of students that fight shadows during the Dark Hour.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
During all the other hours of the day, we experience our protagonist and all the other student’s daily life, while going to school, meeting with people, doing part-time jobs and more. The usual gist of this series. More the characters we meet during the day, better the perks we have in the Dark Hour.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-moon&quot;&gt;New moon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A remake of Persona 3 was something that was highly requested by the fans after the unprecedented success of Persona 5, in 2016. Many of them wondered what it would be of that game with all the graphical improvements and quality of life features of the latest iteration. This year Atlus finally attended the request with great success, I may say.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Persona 3 Reload is a complete graphical overhaul of the original. All the scenarios, character art, menus and everything you can think of were vastly improved and highly stylized. Everything in this game just looks cool. The already amazing soundtrack was also improved, with all the original themes being remade and with the addition of a few new ones, such as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/3znIACSXPLn3HFCf7moZ28?si=c9b1bf6a0c794c36&quot;&gt;new battle theme&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style=&quot;border-radius:12px&quot; src=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/20Bf2RVERC5Bc2eo3vyvJv?utm_source=generator&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;152&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
From a gameplay perspective, apart the expected improvements, this remake is very faithful to the source material, for better or worse. All the key events and game calendar are untouched, as all its social links.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The social links, also known as “confidants” in Persona 5, are an essential element of this series formula, arguably its most iconic even. They consist in friendship ranking systems for each character we meet during the game, with interaction episodes that can level them up. It happens that Persona 3 was the first game to introduce this mechanic, and as with any first iteration of anything, it isn’t perfect. Some of the stories told during those interactions are painfully boring or just dumb, and not even in a funny way. The most aggravating example for me was this classmate we meet that really wants to date his teacher. To advance his social link, his endeavor needs to be encouraged. Obviously while doing that I was going deeply against my intuition. But probably that’s the message the game wants to convey, that sometimes we need to put on a mask to make some friends, who knows. Thankfully Reload introduces a few (much more interesting) extra episodes with some characters that didn’t have social links on the original game. I just wished they touched up the existent social links to make them as good as this new episodes, but I understand why they didn’t.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;c-post__video&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ A glance into the two sides of Persona 3 Reload: the social link episodes during the day and the combat against shadows during the Dark Hour.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Other less positive aspect I noticed during my playthrough was some lack of balance in the gameplay activities. The days in a Persona game are divided into time slots, with the majority of them having two of those slots free for any activity of our choice, being them the afternoon and evening. If we want to visit the Dark Hour, which is fundamental for the game progress, the clock automatically skips the evening slot of the current day. Because of that the original game didn’t have a lot of activities allocated for that slot, to give the players enough time to explore the Dark Hour without missing anything. However, Reload is considerably easier than the original game, requiring less time to reach the goals during the Dark Hour. That made the lack of nighttime activities very evident, specially in the last months of the calendar.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While this last paragraphs sounded too negative, my lasting impressions of Persona 3 Reload are very positive. The only problem was my incredibly high expectations, set by my experience with Persona 4 and 5. I believe I would be more reasonable if P3R was my first Persona game, but because I already know where the series can go in terms of gameplay and storytelling, I ended up being a tiny bit underwhelmed.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arguably the darkest story in the series&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unapologetically stylish&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incredible soundtrack, as usual for Atlus&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Superb voice acting for all characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many social links stories aren’t great&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not much gameplay variety in the latter part of the game
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;great&quot;&gt;Great&lt;span class=&quot;u-ft-sans&quot;&gt;✦✦✦✦✧&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persona 3 Reload is undoubtedly a great remake, improving many outdated aspects of the original game, while keeping the dark and tragic narrative intact. However, by being faithful to the source material, some lackluster elements of it made it to this new reincarnation.

Luckily it was the last one! There was still some time to play a few more things, but not as many as I wanted. Anyway, here’s what I played in May:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Persona 3 Reload&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RPG / PS4
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s done, once and for all! 90 hours spread across 4 months it was all it took to finish this game. I was even very, very close to snag the platinum trophy, missing one single achievement that required starting the game all over again due to my poor planning. It won’t happen though. I think I got my fair dose of Persona for now. Instead I will touch some grass, play other things and write a review of this game (that I will release here when it’s ready).
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Mother 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RPG / GBA
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following my laundry list of games in progress, Mother 3 is the one I want to finish next. Hopefully it won’t take me as long, but I already had to spend some time grinding as this isn’t a particularly easy game. However, the humour, quirkiness and charm of it are keeping me invested on it.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Sonic Adventure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action-adventure / Sega Dreamcast
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a huge Sonic fan since I started playing videogames, with the classic trilogy (&amp;amp; Knuckles) having a special place in my list of favourite games. Sonic Adventure on other hand, not so much. Every time I tried to play it in the past, I never got that far for one reason or another. This time I decided to give it a proper chance. Unfortunately, my opinion of Sonic’s first proper foray into 3D isn’t improving at all. The more I play, the less I understand why this game is taken in such high regards. But this is a story for another day and another review.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That’s all for May! Next month I’ll try to bring more games to talk about, as if it was difficult. Without a time sucker like a Persona game, it’s likely to happen.

Luckily it was the last one! There was still some time to play a few more things, but not as many as I wanted. Anyway, here’s what I played in May:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Phantasy Star</title><link href="https://joaomarques.website/abxy/phantasy-star" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Phantasy Star" /><published>2024-05-26T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-05-26T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://joaomarques.website/abxy/phantasy-star</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://joaomarques.website/abxy/phantasy-star">&lt;p&gt;Phantasy Star might be a name somewhat forgotten in today’s gaming landscape, but it had an important role in the conception of the Japanese role playing game subgenre, dominated nowadays by the likes of Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Persona, Yakuza and many others. In an era where video games were relatively quick and simple experiences, Phantasy Star pushed technological and storytelling boundaries in its medium.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-the-genesis-of-jrpgs&quot;&gt;In the Genesis of JRPGs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid-80’s Sega was a very different company from what it is today. Their bread and butter was their arcade games, where they were able to constantly push the envelope in terms of graphical capabilities. Eager to bring that technological edge to the home consoles market, they released in Japan by 1985 the Sega Mark III, that would be later rebranded as Sega Master System on its international release in 1986. While technically superior to the popular Nintendo Entertainment System (also known as Famicom in Japan), its library of games was much smaller in comparison. Due to the lack of third party support, it was mostly up to Sega to bring new software for their system.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Following the success of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmzHrNVelL0&quot;&gt;Dragon Quest&lt;/a&gt;, released exclusively for Nintendo, Sega decided to create their own RPG to capitalize on the recent interest in this genre and demonstrate once more their technical prowess. Composed by several talented programmers and designers, such as Yuki Naka and Naoto Ohshima (which would be later known for the creation of a certain game featuring a blue hedgehog), the development team had a clear goal - to outdo the competition in every way possible. A traditional medieval fantasy setting was discarded in favor of a story with sci-fi elements. Instead of one overworld with several locations, Phantasy Star had three explorable planets, with their own cities and biomes. The turn-based combat sections had much more detailed enemies and backgrounds than its contemporaries, such as the aforementioned Dragon Quest. Even the dungeons were a technical showcase, with a 3D first person perspective!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ The Sega Ages version of Phantasy Star, the definitive way of playing this classic.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When it released, late in 1987, Phantasy Star had to share the spotlight with the very first Final Fantasy. Even though the later spawned arguably most iconic series of JRPGs ever, Phantasy Star was successful enough to receive three direct sequels on the Sega Mega Drive. The series still survives to this day, although in a MMORPG style, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pso2.com/&quot;&gt;Phantasy Star Online 2 New Genesis&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-took-ages-to-be-this-accessible&quot;&gt;It took ages to be this accessible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrative of this first Phantasy Star is set in the Algol star system, which comprises the planets Palma, Motavia, and Dezoris. The game starts precisely in Palma, with our protagonist, a girl named Alis, witnessing her brother’s death to the hands of the emperor Lassic’s troops. Right before dying he asks her to defeat Lassic, who’s leading their world to destruction. It’s with this motivation that Alis embarks on a journey to achieve that, alongside Odin, a typical strong fighter that wields axes and swords, Noah, your typical magician, and Myau, a yellow alien cat with supernatural powers. This party travels across the three planets to acquire the necessary equipment to defeat Lassic, while also attempting to uncover the truth behind his tyrannical regime by interacting with the natives of each planet.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Although this sounds fun, there is one tiny problem. We are talking about a 37 years old game here, playing it in its original version nowadays is a true test of resilience. That’s where Sega Ages, a long running series of enhanced editions of classics from the company, comes to the rescue. The Sega Ages edition of Phantasy Star was released in 2018 exclusively for the Nintendo Switch, bringing a ton of quality-of-life features such as: dungeon maps, increased XP and money earned from each battle, reduced random encounters, faster walking speed and detailed items stats. Each feature individually makes a difference, but collectively, they transform a game nearly four decades old into a much more enjoyable experience today, allowing players to appreciate its merits without enduring many of the era’s typical pains. One crucial problem that wasn’t solved by this new version was the ability to accidentally ‘softlock’ our progress if we save the game in the wrong place without the right items. While Phantasy Star is a very linear game, it also doesn’t hold the player’s hand. As so, it’s surprisingly easy to miss any crucial if we don’t pay attention to the NPCs. I won’t lie, I didn’t do that and got lost quite easily. I resorted to a guide as soon as that happened. Even with this caveats, I think it was worth to experience this underappreciated classic.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remarkable graphics for 1987 standards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interesting lore that mixes fantasy elements with sci-fi&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sega Ages version makes the experience way more accessible for modern tastes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Way too linear&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s easy to miss crucial elements and ‘softlock’ our progress
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;good&quot;&gt;Good&lt;span class=&quot;u-ft-sans&quot;&gt;✦✦✦✧✧&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phantasy Star definetively deserves more recognition for its achievements in an era where the role-playing game genre was still in its infancy. While it was naturally outclassed in every aspect by many subsquent games, it’s still a worthwhile experience, specially in its Sega Ages version.

This time, as if two JRPGs weren’t enough, I decided to start (and luckily finish) one more. I even had to refrain myself from starting a fourth one. I’m clearly on my JPRG era, much like a teenager obsessed with My Chemical Romance, or whatever they listen these days. It will pass eventually, probably when I finish Persona 3 Reload.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Persona 3 Reload&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RPG / PS4
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we are, once again. I’m starting to run out of things to say about this game, as it makes by now three months since I started playing it. I’m definitely near its final, but from my experience with this series, that’s equivalent to no less than 20 hours of gameplay. At least its story it’s &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; getting interesting.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Mother 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RPG / GBA
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another follow up from last month. I’m having a great time with it so far, with 10 hours clocked in by this point. The more I play it, the more I understand why it wasn’t released outside Japan. I have a feeling that current day Nintendo would never do a game like this. I will save the details for an eventual review.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Phantasy Star&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RPG / Sega Master System
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always had some fascination for Sega’s oldest RPG series, but never had interest in actually playing the games before. That finally changed when I got the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hIwDZqiMD4&quot;&gt;Sega Ages&lt;/a&gt; version of this Master System classic. This version, released for the Nintendo Switch, had a ton of quality of life features that made possible finishing it much faster than the original one. It’s surely a product of its time (and that time is 1987), but in terms of story and world building it’s still very fresh. While every other RPG of this era was focused solely on medieval fantasies, Phantasy Star took its inspiration from science fiction instead.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Streets of Rage 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beat’em’up / Sega Mega Drive
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the objective of giving more use to my Mega Drive, and eventually play Phantasy Star II, III and IV with rom hacks in the original hardware, I got an Everdrive, a cartridge that reads games from an SD card. I decided to test it with one of the best games for the system, Streets of Rage 2. Smashing delinquents to the sound of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXLpubTPO94&quot;&gt;Yuzo Koshiro’s techno soundtrack&lt;/a&gt; is pure dopamine. Without even noticing, I finished it in one try.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That’s all for April. For next month, I promise to bring fewer RPGs. See you next time!

Since this show is set in the same universe as the games and is technically part of the story canon, a review here isn’t too out of place. I’m also taking the opportunity to talk about it while it’s still a hot topic. Keep in mind that even if this review isn’t spoiler heavy, I will mention some facts and events that you might want to discover by yourself, if you haven’t watched the TV show yet.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-vault-life&quot;&gt;A vault life&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fallout universe is set in an alternate reality where nuclear bombs were massively deployed soon after World War II, profoundly affecting human scientific and technological advancements, culture, and the planet’s ecosystem. This led to the origin of the “wasteland”, where survival is the primary concern.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Away from the dire reality of the wasteland, a few selected individuals live in underground vaults spread across the United States. It’s precisely in one of this vaults that this show starts. We are quickly introduced to one of the main characters, Lucy, and to the busy life inside the vault 33, as the main goal of the vault dwellers - to repopulate the surface once the radiation levels are dissipated from it. However, things went terribly wrong for the inhabitants of Vault 33 when they were invaded and massacred by wastelanders, who also abducted Lucy’s father, the vault overseer, in the process. Lucy then decides to leave the vault for the first time in her life to find her father, echoing Fallout 3’s prologue.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There were still a lot of questions to answer regarding what happened in vault 33. Thankfuly the show does a great job on exploring the motivations behind such tragedy, as the mystery involving two other interconnected vaults, 31 and 32, conducted by the few survivors. Although this subplot was one of the most interesting parts of the show, it unfortunately remained unresolved. Let’s hope it has a follow up in season 2.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;c-post__video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/V-mugKDQDlg&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ The trailer unveils the three main characters: Lucy, Maximus and Cooper.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-wasteland-journey&quot;&gt;The wasteland journey&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already on the wasteland, Lucy’s path crosses with Maximus, a member of Brotherhood of Steel, a military order with the goal of control humanity’s most advanced technologies. Always mistreated inside the order, Maximus was sent on a mission to support a soldier retrieving a particular piece of technology. Unsurprisingly, the mission deviated from the plan, but Maximus gained the upper hand by seizing control of the soldier’s armor. Then we get the classic arc of the underdog that once it reaches the top, becomes what he despised the most. While not deal breaking for me, I just didn’t found his story interesting at all, specially because his realization comes really sudently and by the end he’s already the same old good natured underdog, but simply more powerful.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The third main character, who also crosses with Lucy during her journey, is in my opinion the most interesting one. Formerly a Hollywood actor and propaganda man for Vault-Tec, the company responsible for the underground vaults, Cooper Howard has since become a ghoul due to the devastating effects of the nuclear bombs. In this universe, ghouls are essentially people who got too much exposure to radiation, giving them a decomposed appearance, but also a much prolonged life span. During the entire season, our point of view from Cooper is constantly shifting between the past, before the bombing, and the present. What led him to accept doing advertisement for Vault-tec, oblivious of their obscure interests, and what made him eventually become the sour and ruthless ghoul he is.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Creating an original narrative and new characters was a winning choice from the showrunners. It gives something new for everyone, either long time fans or newcomers to the complex Fallout universe. What makes this show trully special however, is how they were able to capture perfectly the games’ essence, consisting of a mixture of dry (and sometimes dark) humor, some spectacularly gory scenes and a retro-futuristic aesthetic heavily inspired by the post-war America from the 40’s and 50’s.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fallout lore was used to perfection to build a brand new story&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The series typical dry humor and ocasional gore are present here&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A great introduction for newcomers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A lot of callbacks to the games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maximus story arc was a bit too cliché for my taste&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vault 31, 32 and 33 mystery didn’t have a proper resolution
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;great&quot;&gt;Great&lt;span class=&quot;u-ft-sans&quot;&gt;✦✦✦✦✧&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fallout, the TV show, joined the recent trend of great videogame adaptations, reviving the interest in a franchise that was dormant since the controversial release of Fallout 76. In case you have Amazon Prime, go watch it. In case you don’t, use a free trial. It’ll be worth, believe me.

I can’t. For me at least it was a quite hectic month, reflected with the radio silence here in this last few weeks, since the release of the post celebrating the &lt;a href=&quot;https://joaomarques.website/abxy/7-years-nintendo-switch&quot;&gt;7 years of Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;. But enough of excuses. For this catch up, I bring a respectable amount of games, all things considered, but most of my time was invested in two japanese RPGs with a number 3 on their title. Quite fitting for the third month of the year, don’t you think? Without further ado, here’s what I played in March:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Metal Gear Solid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action-adventure / PS1
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally understand all the cult status behind Hideo Kojima and the Metal Gear franchise, now that I finished Metal Gear Solid. For a PS1 game from 1998 it has aged very gracefully, due to its voice acting, cinematography and gameplay. I will keep it short for now, as I will eventually do a review for this game. I have too many things to say about it, I just don’t know yet how to phrase them.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Persona 3 Reload&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RPG / PS4
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;em&gt;full-time job&lt;/em&gt; of this month. With 40 hours clocked in so far, I don’t know exactly how many I still have left in this expansive RPG, but I’m enjoying it so far. One thing I have to mention though, is the social links, which are essentially the friendships we can have in the game. Many of them suck, with the interactions with those characters ranging from painfully cringe to just boring. This was an aspect that was &lt;em&gt;vastly&lt;/em&gt; improved in Persona &lt;a href=&quot;https://joaomarques.website/abxy/persona-4-golden&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://joaomarques.website/abxy/persona-5-royal&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action-adventure / PS3
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still fresh from Metal Gear Solid, it was only logical that I would want to play its sequel. With that in mind I got a PS3, as it is to this day the only platform where the series can be played in its entirety. Regarding this second game, I only watched the 15 minute long intro cutscene and did not much else, but it got me intrigued.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Formula One Championship Edition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racing / PS3
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the start of the F1 season, I went to search for a good classic F1 game. I ended up finding this Formula One Championship Edition, a game developed by the creators of Wipeout that served as a launch title for the PS3, with an accurate representation of 2006 F1 season. Many aspects of this game held up quite well to this day, such as the graphics, gameplay… and the presence of Fernando Alonso, already world champion by the time this game was released.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Mother 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RPG / GBA
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few series have a stronger cult status as Mother. One of the major causes for it, beside its uniqueness, is the mystery behind its international localizations. During many years, Mother 2 was the only game of the series officially released outside Japan, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGOEMCG2Ll4&quot;&gt;Earthbound&lt;/a&gt;. Mother 1 was released out of the blue for the Wii U Virtual Console in 2015, 26 years after the japanese version, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttKkiEKqwuk&quot;&gt;Earthbound Beginnings&lt;/a&gt;. As for Mother 3, arguably the best of the bunch, it suffered the worst fate, never receiving an international release to this day. Luckily, a group of talented fans did what &lt;em&gt;Nintendon’t&lt;/em&gt; and created an incredible &lt;a href=&quot;https://mother3.fobby.net/&quot;&gt;english translation&lt;/a&gt;. It’s thanks to them that I’m now playing this game.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Star Fox Command&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoot’em up / Nintendo DS
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing a video from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@GVG&quot;&gt;Good Vibes Gaming&lt;/a&gt; (a great Youtube channel that I totally recommend) about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_d3H2bkZHM&quot;&gt;improving Nintendo DS games on the 3DS&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to try this Star Fox Command, as it was mentioned there. Unlike the other games in the series, this one combines the spaceship flying and shooting with some turn based tactics, which is totally my jam. So far it has been a pleasant surprise.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And that’s all for March. For next month, I have no idea, but I’ll try to focus on what I already have in progress. I need some closure, and closure won’t come if I keep adding games to my backlog.

But enough of excuses. For this catch up, I bring a respectable amount of games, all things considered, but most of my time was invested in two japanese RPGs with a number 3 on their title. Quite fitting for the third month of the year, don’t you think?

The world was different back then, as Nintendo itself. Nowadays it seems almost unthinkable, but the house of Mario was in serious trouble before the release of the hybrid system that revolutionised the gaming market and gave a whole new life to portable systems. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s look back at the inception of the Nintendo Switch, how it became so successful and what it still has left to give.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nintendos-ace-in-the-hole&quot;&gt;Nintendo’s ace in the hole&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying that Nintendo had a few rough years before the release of the Switch is quite an understatement. After the staggering success of the Wii, the company decided to release its successor, the Wii U, in 2012. Although, its confusing proposition, baffling name and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3qaPg_keg&quot;&gt;terrible marketing&lt;/a&gt; caused it to flop hard. For “hardcore” gamers, it wasn’t powerful enough to deliver the third party games present on the other systems (which was already a problem with the original Wii), and the “casual” audience didn’t even understand that Wii U was actually a new system, neither needed one (as most of them only played Wii Sports anyway). Even the relative success of the Nintendo 3DS wasn’t enough to compensate for the huge financial losses caused by this misstep. As a consequence of that, the company’s president Satoru Iwata famously cut his salary in half to avoid layoffs, a move that made him be in good graces of many fans, alongside his charisma and genuine passion for gaming. Unsurprisingly, his death in 2015 was another hard blow in Nintendo’s already low spirits.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everything was doom and gloom though, with the development of the next system being already underway. In that same year the first news about it surfaced, while the full reveal only happened one year later, in 2016. It was undoubtedly a smart move. Nintendo always had a strong grasp on the portable gaming market, so, an hybrid system like the Switch was the logical step in hindsight. Instead of supporting two systems simultaneously, like it happened before (the 3DS still coexisted with the Switch for a couple of years, but it was quickly phased out), they could combine all their efforts on a single platform. Of course there were still concerns about the system modest specs, as it could fall in the same pattern of not getting third party multi-platform games due the disparity with the other available systems. Luckily the Nintendo Switch was a success right out of the box when it launched, in March 3 2017, in due part to their &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; ace in the hole.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ The Nintendo Switch was introduced to the world with this trailer, back in late 2016.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-all-about-the-games&quot;&gt;It’s all about the games&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lineup of games available on launch day was nothing to write home about, but it didn’t matter. The highly anticipated The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was the most compelling argument to get the Switch day one. The game was so successful that not only revolutionised the Zelda franchise, but the entire open-world genre. While it was also released simultaneously for the Wii U, it was more out of obligation its loyal user base, since it was developed with that system in mind to begin with.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Breath of the Wild was enough to keep the new Switch owners busy for a few weeks (if not months), but the first year of the console would see an influx of great exclusive releases, such as Splatoon 2, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Super Mario Odyssey. By the end of 2017, it was clear that the Switch was here to stay. With a good user base and the novelty of playing on TV or on the go, third party developers interest grew substantially. The efforts put in ports like Skyrim, The Witcher 3, Doom or Dark Souls proved that there was market for this kind of re-releases. The graphical downgrade was a compromise many people were willing to accept, with the prospect of having the flexibility of playing this games on a portable form factor. The indie scene was (and still is) also a force to be reckoned with in the Switch library. Since those games usually aren’t as graphically demanding as high budget ones, they are released on Nintendo’s system without compromises, making the Switch the ideal place to play them.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In my case, what made me jump to the Switch bandwagon was the release of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, in late 2018. I was already a fan of the series, so, when Ultimate was announced with the promisse of including all the characters from the previous entries, I knew it was time to get a Switch. Sadly I had to wait a few months to play it, since the physical edition of the game was sold out everywhere during that holiday season. Instead I ended up picking Super Mario Odyssey as my first Switch game. Case to say that I had no regrets with that decision, because it was absolutely fantastic! It became instantly my favourite Mario game.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ The game reveal that made me buy a Switch back in the day.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;something-called-animal-crossing&quot;&gt;Something called Animal Crossing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Switch concept was more than solidified to the gaming audience, it wasn’t until the release of Animal Crossing: New Horizons that the system had its breakout moment with the casual public. Animal Crossing was a life simulation series where the player could live a parallel life with cute anthropomorphic animals, following the real life time and calendar. After a few years of hiatus, the fans were eager for the series return. The concept of this new entry, titled New Horizons, was to move to a deserted island and developing it with cultivations, houses, infrastructures and more, while creating relationships with the few animals who choose to live there as well. The game looked great and promissed a ton of content, judging by the trailers revealed until then. The hype machine was building up for the game release in March of 2020. I don’t know if you remember by now, but there was &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; global trend that started to grow insanely that same month. Covid-19 forced many of us to obligatory lockdowns and many people started looking into forms of escapism to deal with the situation. What could be more enticing than living a nice life in a island far away from all the real world problems?
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
From that point onwards sales of the system and software skyrocketed and a new wave of games appeared trying to appeal to this new audience interested in farming simulators and “cozy” games. The Switch truly felt like a system for everyone.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;c-post__video&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ Animal Crossing: New Horizons success is one of the best examples of right place, right time.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fading-into-the-sunset&quot;&gt;Fading into the sunset&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything good eventually comes to an end, as is the case with the Switch. While 2023 was still an incredible year in terms of new releases, (Super Mario Wonder, &lt;a href=&quot;https://joaomarques.website/abxy/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom&quot;&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://joaomarques.website/abxy/pikmin-4&quot;&gt;Pikmin 4&lt;/a&gt;, to name a few), 2024 looks much more bleak in contrast. Most of the exclusive titles of this year are essentially remakes and remasters, some justifiable (Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door), others not really (Mario vs Donkey Kong). Having the knowledge to make an educated guess, I say this is a clear sign that the main development efforts are being put somewhere else, very likely in a new system. This statement can age either like wine or milk, but I’m truly confident that this will be the last year of the Switch as the main Nintendo system, with the reveal of the next one not very far away.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It’s impossible to know for sure what’s going to happen next, but nobody can take from us the seven years of the tiny gaming tablet (yes, it has a touchscreen, even if few games used it) that served as home for some of the finest games ever made.

I’m fully aware that this blog is one step short of transforming into a Persona Fan Club, but that’s a risk I’m willing to take. Anyway, I still had time to play a few other things. Here’s what February looked like:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Persona 3 Reload&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RPG / PS4
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one was a given. As soon as the remake of the third Persona game was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIIPXA2A6cM&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;, with new visuals and quality-of-life improvements brought from Persona 5, I knew it was a day one purchase for me. My time with this game so far has been great, with around 20 hours clocked in. I’m still relatively in the beginning of the story, as nothing really interesting happened yet, but the combat and character development are keeping me engaged so far.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hack’n’slash / Nintendo Switch
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a week away from home (and from Persona 3 Reload), as so I took the opportunity to bring the Switch with me and play a short game from my backlog, with No More Heroes 2 being the chosen one. You can already read &lt;a href=&quot;https://joaomarques.website/abxy/no-more-heroes-2&quot;&gt;my review of it&lt;/a&gt;, in case you didn’t yet.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;u-mt-0 u-mb-1&quot;&gt;Metal Gear Solid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action-adventure / PS1
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To close the month, I decided to finally dive into Hideo Kojima’s best-known series. While in the beginning I struggled a bit to truly understand the game mechanics, now I’m completely hooked. It’s hard to believe this game is 25 years old, with the only evidence of that being the charming PS1 polygonal graphics.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And that’s all for February. Not a lot of games, but the few ones were really worth my time. For next month, expect more Persona and more Metal Gear Solid. See you next time!

Brainchild of the extravagant game designer Goichi Suda (AKA Suda51), No More Heroes is heavily characterized by a mix of over-the-top violence, a self-aware sense of humor, and a ton of references and homages to other games and movies. Imagine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wd5KEaOtm4&quot;&gt;Scott Pilgrim&lt;/a&gt;, but with much more blood and censurable language.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While not published by Nintendo, this series is somewhat associated with their systems, as the two first games were designed around the Wii, and the third one around the Nintendo Switch. It was precisely with the third installment that I discovered this series, as it was revealed during a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91HU_mc9cts&quot;&gt;Nintendo Direct&lt;/a&gt;. I started my journey with No More Heroes with its first game though, to get some knowledge of the lore and characters. But after that, in a hurry to play the newest game, I decided to completely ignore the second one. I must admit I didn’t regret that decision, as I absolutely loved No More Heroes III, despite its flaws.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For a long time, I had no interest in playing No More Heroes 2, as I was almost sure I wouldn’t like it as much as its successor, but now, almost two years later, I finally decided to give it a chance. It turns out my assumption was right, but I still had a good time with it.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ranking-up-by-revenge&quot;&gt;Ranking up by revenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first No More Heroes we play as Travis Touchdown, a professional assassin with a unique taste for wrestling and anime, that’s challanged by a girl to climb up to the first rank of the UAA (United Assassins Association) in order to have a chance with her. That’s it, that’s the premisse.
And how exactly does the process of ranking up works? With deadly one-on-one matches with each ranked assassin. After reaching the number one rank and ending up without the girl, as she decides to not honor her part of the deal, Travis decides to retire from the “business”. All is good until his best friend is killed by revenge for someone Travis killed before. Coincidently, the person who plots this assassination is now the new number one of the UAA ranking.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is with this renewed motivation that Travis Touchdown decides to rank up once again, marking the start of No More Heroes 2. Unlike the first game, where he started ranked 11th, he’s now ranked at a distant 51st place. While initially it’s assumed that we would need to do 50 battles to get our desired revenge, we soon realize that the game defies our expectations by killing off more than half of those assassins off-screen during the course of the story at the most unexpected times. By the end of the game we end up actually fighting, and killing, 15 of those assassins.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking on combat, that’s the aspect that had the biggest improvement comparing with its predecessor. While in the first game the combat relied mostly on counter-attacks, making it a waiting game most of the times, this one gives more freedom to approach the enemies, be it by brute force, hit and run, or still by counter-attack.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;c-post__video&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ One of the many ranking battles we face during the game.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-more-side-jobs&quot;&gt;No more side jobs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important part of this series uniqueness lies in everything else we do beside fighting. Unfortunately that’s where in my opinion No More Heroes 2 fumbles the most. In the other games we are somewhat forced to do random jobs to have money to pay the ranked battles entry fees, with those jobs ranging from minor killing sprees to some mundane tasks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEIkr5RceJQ&quot;&gt;lawn mowing or unclogging toilets&lt;/a&gt;. It’s ridiculous for sure, but that’s the point. It’s satirical.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are still side jobs in No More Heroes 2, but they are presented in an 8-bit style this time around. They are mildly fun, but mostly useless. Unlike on the other two games, here there are no entry fees for the ranked battles, as so, the money can only be used to buy new clothes, weapons and going to the gym (to upgrade life and attack power). But even considering the gym upgrades, which are in fact useful, there is no need to hustle for extra cash, as we can gather enough just by going through the ranked battles. Buying weapons isn’t necessary as well, especially when the best one is given to Travis during the course of the story. The game can be entirely played without even interacting with this extra content, as it doesn’t even have a freely explorable hub world, being replaced by a simple menu.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;c-post__img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;c-post__video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vsVFxY2S1o4&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;❖ All the side jobs plays like a NES game.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All things considered, nothing in No More Heroes 2 is actually bad, but the decision to cut the open world exploration (that made its comeback on No More Heroes III) and the battle entry fees made a huge part of the game completely redundant. I still did every side job anyway, but they just felt like a mini-game compilation attached without rhyme or reason to a good hack’n’slash game.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refined hack’n’slash mechanics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nonsense story is backed by its unique sense of humor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most ranked battles are epic and incredibly fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Almost all side content is pretty much pointless&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lack of open world exploration
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;good&quot;&gt;Good&lt;span class=&quot;u-ft-sans&quot;&gt;✦✦✦✧✧&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No More Heroes 2 is the definition of two steps forward one step back. While the main course is definitely an improvement from its predecessor, literally everything else is a letdown.
